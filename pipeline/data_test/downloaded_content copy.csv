No. 01-3-64-MTC. December 05, 2001 ] IN RE: NOTICE ISSUED BY JUDGE AGAPITO K. LAOAGAN, JR., MTC, LA TRINIDAD, BENGUET SUSPENDING THE HEARING OF CASES IN HIS COURT R E S O L U T I O N PUNO, J.: Just as litigants have the duty not to waste the precious time of the court, judges likewise ought not to waste one moment of the litigants' time. The less time the litigants spend in pending court cases, the more productive they can become in their other pursuits. Speedy dispensation of justice not only builds the faith and confidence of the people in the judiciary, but also catalyzes progress. On January 2, 2001, Judge Agapito Laoagan, Jr. issued, without authority, a notice suspending the hearing of cases in his court.  His notice of suspension read, viz : ""To all lawyers and litigants: All trials and hearings are hereby suspended in this court, except promulgation of judgments and those pertaining to provisional remedies and criminal cases involving detention prisoners, until the designation of an acting judge. The undersigned will dispose off (sic) cases already submitted for judgment in preparation to his assumption of office as Attorney VI and Regional Hearing Officer of NCIP-CAR. (Sgd.) AGAPITO K. LAOAGAN, JR. MTC Judge"" A copy of the notice of suspension was sent by the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Benguet, Judge Nelsonida Marrero, to the Office of the Chief Justice (OCJ). On February 28, 2001, the OCJ, in its 1st Indorsement , referred the matter to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for appropriate action. The OCA recommended that Judge Laoagan, Jr. be required to explain why he should not be held administratively liable for his unauthorized suspension of the trials and hearings of cases pending before his court. On April 2, 2001, the Court resolved to adopt this recommendation of the OCA. Judge Laoagan submitted his explanation dated May 5, 2001, viz : ""1. On December 23, 2000, I received an Appointment as Regional Hearing Officer of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) from the Chairman of NCIP-CAR dated December 1, 2000, attached as Annex 'A'; 2. On January 2, 2001, presuming that I can easily secure an Authority to Transfer from the Chief Justice, I unilaterally suspended trials and hearings except that of provisional remedies, criminal cases involving detention prisoners and promulgation of judgments because as of December 31, 2000, many civil and criminal cases were due for judgment and I wanted to dispose them off (sic) before I transferred to the NCIP ; 3. On January 10, 2001, I wrote the Hon. Chief Justice a request for the issuance of a Permission to Transfer. The request was granted on February 5, 2001, but I was furnished a copy only on February 23, 2001. A copy of said transfer is attached as Annex 'B'; 4. On February 26, 2001, I wrote my Executive Judge, Judge Nelsonida Marrero, a letter informing her of my Authority to Transfer and requested her to designate an Acting Judge for my court effective March 1, 2001, to avoid a hiatus in the operation of my court, a copy of which is attached as Annex 'C'. Instead of designating an Acting Judge, she sent a copy of my Notice of Suspension to the Chief Justice, thus this administrative case; 5. When I was about to transfer to the NCIP-CAR on March 1, 2001, I found out that my transfer is covered by the election ban. In view thereof, I plan to transfer only after the election, with your permission; 6. I resumed full court sessions on April 1, 2001. In view hereof, I am planning to transfer after the election, with your permission. If ever I committed an administrative wrong I beg for your understanding. Nonetheless, I am wiling (sic) to accept any penalty commensurate to my acts."" [1] The OCA found Judge Laoagan administratively liable and recommended, viz : ""IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, it is respectfully submitted for the consideration of the Honorable Court with the recommendation that a FINE in the amount of TWO THOUSAND (P2,000.00) Pesos be imposed against Hon. Agapito K. Laoagan, Jr., Presiding Judge of Municipal Trial Court, La Trinidad, Benguet."" We adopt the recommendation of the OCA. The Code of Judicial Conduct provides in Canon 1, Rule 1.02 and Canon 3, Rule 3.05, viz : ""Rule 1.02. A judge should administer justice impartially and without delay. (emphasis supplied)"" xxx Rule 3.05. A judge should dispose of the court's business promptly and decide cases within the required periods. (emphasis supplied)"" It cannot be overemphasized that judges have the sworn duty to administer justice without delay for ""delay in the disposition of cases erodes the faith and confidence of our people in the judiciary; lowers its standards and brings it into disrepute."" [2] Respondent judge's precipitate suspension of trials and hearings in his sala prior to his request for permission from the Chief Justice for an authority to transfer to the NCIP unduly delayed the dispensation of justice in his court. As a judge, respondent should have exercised more prudence and should have given an allowance of time for the processing of his request which he belatedly filed on January 10, 2001 or eight days after he issued the suspension notice on January 2, 2001. We also note that as early as March 1, 2001, respondent judge already learned that his transfer to the NCIP was covered by the election ban, thereby postponing it until after the May 2001 elections. He, however, resumed full court sessions only on April 1, 2001, or one month thereafter, when he could have resumed full court sessions immediately after March 1, 2001. In light of these circumstances, we find that respondent judge should be held administratively liable. However, as pointed out by the OCA, his liability is mitigated by his not being totally remiss in his duties as he continued trials and hearings on provisional remedies, criminal cases involving detention prisoners and promulgation of judgments. WHEREFORE, Judge Agapito K. Laoagan, Jr., Presiding Judge of Municipal Trial Court, La Trinidad, Benguet is held administratively liable for delay and neglect of duty and is hereby ordered to pay a FINE in the amount of TWO THOUSAND PESOS (P2,000.00).

D E C I S I O N PANGANIBAN, J.: The party-list system is a social justice tool designed not only to give more law to the great masses of our people who have less in life, but also to enable them to become veritable lawmakers themselves, empowered to participate directly in the enactment of laws designed to benefit them. It intends to make the marginalized and the underrepresented not merely passive recipients of the State’s benevolence, but active participants in the mainstream of representative democracy. Thus, allowing all individuals and groups, including those which now dominate district elections, to have the same opportunity to participate in party-list elections would desecrate this lofty objective and mongrelize the social justice mechanism into an atrocious veneer for traditional politics. The Case Before us are two Petitions under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, challenging Omnibus Resolution No. 3785 [1] issued by the Commission on Elections (Comelec) on March 26, 2001. This Resolution approved the participation of 154 organizations and parties, including those herein impleaded, in the 2001 party-list elections. Petitioners seek the disqualification of private respondents, arguing mainly that the party-list system was intended to benefit the marginalized and underrepresented; not the mainstream political parties, the non-marginalized or overrepresented. The Factual Antecedents With the onset of the 2001 elections, the Comelec received several Petitions for registration filed by sectoral parties, organizations and political parties. According to the Comelec, “[v]erifications were made as to the status and capacity of these parties and organizations and hearings were scheduled day and night until the last party w[as] heard. With the number of these petitions and the observance of the legal and procedural requirements, review of these petitions as well as deliberations takes a longer process in order to arrive at a decision and as a result the two (2) divisions promulgated a separate Omnibus Resolution and individual resolution on political parties. These numerous petitions and processes observed in the disposition of these petition[s] hinder the early release of the Omnibus Resolutions of the Divisions which were promulgated only on 10 February 2001.” [2] Thereafter, before the February 12, 2001 deadline prescribed under Comelec Resolution No. 3426 dated December 22, 2000, the registered parties and organizations filed their respective Manifestations, stating their intention to participate in the party-list elections. Other sectoral and political parties and organizations whose registrations were denied also filed Motions for Reconsideration, together with Manifestations of their intent to participate in the party-list elections. Still other registered parties filed their Manifestations beyond the deadline. The Comelec gave due course or approved the Manifestations (or accreditations) of 154 parties and organizations, but denied those of several others in its assailed March 26, 2001 Omnibus Resolution No. 3785, which we quote: “We carefully deliberated the foregoing matters, having in mind that this system of proportional representation scheme will encourage multi-partisan [sic] and enhance the inability of small, new or sectoral parties or organization to directly participate in this electoral window. “It will be noted that as defined, the ‘party-list system’ is a ‘mechanism of proportional representation’ in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives from national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof registered with the Commission on Elections. “However, in the course of our review of the matters at bar, we must recognize the fact that there is a need to keep the number of sectoral parties, organizations and coalitions, down to a manageable level, keeping only those who substantially comply with the rules and regulations and more importantly the sufficiency of the Manifestations or evidence on the Motions for Reconsiderations or Oppositions.” [3] On April 10, 2001, Akbayan Citizens Action Party filed before the Comelec a Petition praying that “the names of [some of herein respondents] be deleted from the ‘Certified List of Political Parties/Sectoral Parties/Organizations/Coalitions Participating in the Party List System for the May 14, 2001 Elections’ and that said certified list be accordingly amended.” It also asked, as an alternative, that the votes cast for the said respondents not be counted or canvassed, and that the latter’s nominees not be proclaimed. [4] On April 11, 2001, Bayan Muna and Bayan Muna-Youth also filed a Petition for Cancellation of Registration and Nomination against some of herein respondents. [5] On April 18, 2001, the Comelec required the respondents in the two disqualification cases to file Comments within three days from notice. It also set the date for hearing on April 26, 2001, [6] but subsequently reset it to May 3, 2001. [7] During the hearing, however, Commissioner Ralph C. Lantion merely directed the parties to submit their respective memoranda. [8] Meanwhile, dissatisfied with the pace of the Comelec, Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party filed a Petition [9] before this Court on April 16, 2001. This Petition, docketed as GR No. 147589, assailed Comelec Omnibus Resolution No. 3785. In its Resolution dated April 17, 2001, [10] the Court directed respondents to comment on the Petition within a non-extendible period of five days from notice. [11] On April 17, 2001, Petitioner Bayan Muna also filed before this Court a Petition, [12] docketed as GR No. 147613, also challenging Comelec Omnibus Resolution No. 3785. In its Resolution dated May 9, 2001, [13] the Court ordered the consolidation of the two Petitions before it; directed respondents named in the second Petition to file their respective Comments on or before noon of May 15, 2001; and called the parties to an Oral Argument on May 17, 2001. It added that the Comelec may proceed with the counting and canvassing of votes cast for the party-list elections, but barred the proclamation of any winner therein, until further orders of the Court. Thereafter, Comments [14] on the second Petition were received by the Court and, on May 17, 2001, the Oral Argument was conducted as scheduled. In an Order given in open court, the parties were directed to submit their respective Memoranda simultaneously within a non-extendible period of five days. [15] Issues: During the hearing on May 17, 2001, the Court directed the parties to address the following issues: “1. Whether or not recourse under Rule 65 is proper under the premises. More specifically, is there no other plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law? “2. Whether or not political parties may participate in the party-list elections. “3. Whether or not the party-list system is exclusive to ‘marginalized and underrepresented’ sectors and organizations. “4. Whether or not the Comelec committed grave abuse of discretion in promulgating Omnibus Resolution No. 3785.” [16] The Court’s Ruling The Petitions are partly meritorious. These cases should be remanded to the Comelec which will determine, after summary evidentiary hearings, whether the 154 parties and organizations enumerated in the assailed Omnibus Resolution satisfy the requirements of the Constitution and RA 7941, as specified in this Decision. First Issue: Recourse Under Rule 65 Respondents contend that the recourse of both petitioners under Rule 65 is improper because there are other plain, speedy and adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law. [17] The Office of the Solicitor General argues that petitioners should have filed before the Comelec a petition either for disqualification or for cancellation of registration, pursuant to Sections 19, 20, 21 and 22 of Comelec Resolution No. 3307-A [18] dated November 9, 2000. [19] We disagree. At bottom, petitioners attack the validity of Comelec Omnibus Resolution 3785 for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion, insofar as it allowed respondents to participate in the party-list elections of 2001. Indeed, under both the Constitution [20] and the Rules of Court, such challenge may be brought before this Court in a verified petition for certiorari under Rule 65. Moreover, the assailed Omnibus Resolution was promulgated by Respondent Commission en banc; hence, no motion for reconsideration was possible, it being a prohibited pleading under Section 1 (d), Rule 13 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure. [21] The Court also notes that Petitioner Bayan Muna had filed before the Comelec a Petition for Cancellation of Registration and Nomination against some of herein respondents. [22] The Comelec, however, did not act on that Petition. In view of the pendency of the elections, Petitioner Bayan Muna sought succor from this Court, for there was no other adequate recourse at the time. Subsequent events have proven the urgency of petitioner’s action; to this date, the Comelec has not yet formally resolved the Petition before it. But a resolution may just be a formality because the Comelec, through the Office of the Solicitor General, has made its position on the matter quite clear. In any event, this case presents an exception to the rule that certiorari shall lie only in the absence of any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy. [23] It has been held that certiorari is available, notwithstanding the presence of other remedies, “where the issue raised is one purely of law, where public interest is involved, and in case of urgency.” [24] Indeed, the instant case is indubitably imbued with public interest and with extreme urgency, for it potentially involves the composition of 20 percent of the House of Representatives. Moreover, this case raises transcendental constitutional issues on the party-list system, which this Court must urgently resolve, consistent with its duty to “formulate guiding and controlling constitutional principles, precepts, doctrines, or rules.” [25] Finally, procedural requirements “may be glossed over to prevent a miscarriage of justice, when the issue involves the principle of social justice x x x when the decision sought to be set aside is a nullity, or when the need for relief is extremely urgent and certiorari is the only adequate and speedy remedy available.” [26] Second Issue: Participation of Political Parties In its Petition, Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party contends that “the inclusion of political parties in the party-list system is the most objectionable portion of the questioned Resolution.” [27] For its part, Petitioner Bayan Muna objects to the participation of “major political parties.” [28] On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General, like the impleaded political parties, submits that the Constitution and RA No. 7941 allow political parties to participate in the party-list elections. It argues that the party-list system is, in fact, open to all “registered national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations.” [29] We now rule on this issue. Under the Constitution and RA 7941, private respondents cannot be disqualified from the party-list elections, merely on the ground that they are political parties. Section 5, Article VI of the Constitution provides that members of the House of Representatives may “be elected through a party-list system of registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations.” Furthermore, under Sections 7 and 8, Article IX (C) of the Constitution, political parties may be registered under the party-list system. “Sec. 7. No votes cast in favor of a political party , organization, or coalition shall be valid, except for those registered under the party-list system as provided in this Constitution. “Sec. 8. Political parties , or organizations or coalitions registered under the party-list system , shall not be represented in the voters' registration boards, boards of election inspectors, boards of canvassers, or other similar bodies. However, they shall be entitled to appoint poll watchers in accordance with law.” [30] During the deliberations in the Constitutional Commission, Comm. Christian S. Monsod pointed out that the participants in the party-list system may “be a regional party, a sectoral party, a national party, UNIDO, [31] Magsasaka, or a regional party in Mindanao."" [32] This was also clear from the following exchange between Comms. Jaime Tadeo and Blas Ople: [33] “MR. TADEO. Naniniwala ba kayo na ang party list ay pwedeng paghati-hatian ng UNIDO, PDP-Laban, PNP, Liberal at Nacionalista? MR. OPLE. Maaari yan sapagkat bukas ang party list system sa lahat ng mga partido.” Indeed, Commissioner Monsod stated that the purpose of the party-list provision was to open up the system, in order to give a chance to parties that consistently place third or fourth in congressional district elections to win a seat in Congress. [34] He explained: “The purpose of this is to open the system. In the past elections, we found out that there were certain groups or parties that, if we count their votes nationwide, have about 1,000,000 or 1,500,000 votes. But they were always third or fourth place in each of the districts. So, they have no voice in the Assembly. But this way, they would have five or six representatives in the Assembly even if they would not win individually in legislative districts. So, that is essentially the mechanics, the purpose and objectives of the party-list system.” For its part, Section 2 of RA 7941 also provides for “a party-list system of registered national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, x x x.” Section 3 expressly states that a “party” is “either a political party or a sectoral party or a coalition of parties.” More to the point, the law defines “political party” as “an organized group of citizens advocating an ideology or platform, principles and policies for the general conduct of government and which, as the most immediate means of securing their adoption, regularly nominates and supports certain of its leaders and members as candidates for public office.” Furthermore, Section 11 of RA 7941 leaves no doubt as to the participation of political parties in the party-list system. We quote the pertinent provision below: “x x x                                       x x x                                  x x x “For purposes of the May 1998 elections, the first five (5) major political parties on the basis of party representation in the House of Representatives at the start of the Tenth Congress of the Philippines shall not be entitled to participate in the party-list system. “x x x                                       x x x                                  x x x” Indubitably, therefore, political parties – even the major ones -- may participate in the party-list elections. Third Issue: Marginalized and Underrepresented That political parties may participate in the party-list elections does not mean, however, that any political party -- or any organization or group for that matter -- may do so. The requisite character of these parties or organizations must be consistent with the purpose of the party-list system, as laid down in the Constitution and RA 7941. Section 5, Article VI of the Constitution, provides as follows: “(1) The House of Representatives shall be composed of not more than two hundred and fifty members, unless otherwise fixed by law , who shall be elected from legislative districts apportioned among the provinces, cities, and the Metropolitan Manila area in accordance with the number of their respective inhabitants, and on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio, and those who, as provided by law , shall be elected through a party-list system of registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations. (2) The party-list representatives shall constitute twenty per centum of the total number of representatives including those under the party list. For three consecutive terms after the ratification of this Constitution, one-half of the seats allocated to party-list representatives shall be filled, as provided by law , by selection or election from the labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, women, youth, and such other sectors as may be provided by law , except the religious sector.” (Emphasis supplied.) Notwithstanding the sparse language of the provision, a distinguished member of the Constitutional Commission declared that the purpose of the party-list provision was to give “genuine power to our people” in Congress. Hence, when the provision was discussed, he exultantly announced: “On this first day of August 1986, we shall, hopefully, usher in a new chapter to our national history, by giving genuine power to our people in the legislature.” [35] The foregoing provision on the party-list system is not self-executory. It is, in fact, interspersed with phrases like “in accordance with law” or “as may be provided by law”; it was thus up to Congress to sculpt in granite the lofty objective of the Constitution. Hence, RA 7941 was enacted. It laid out the statutory policy in this wise: “SEC. 2. Declaration of Policy . -- The State shall promote proportional representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives through a party-list system of registered national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, which will enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole, to become members of the House of Representatives. Towards this end, the State shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives by enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature, and shall provide the simplest scheme possible.” The Marginalized and Underrepresented to Become Lawmakers Themselves The foregoing provision mandates a state policy of promoting proportional representation by means of the Filipino-style party-list system, which will “enable” the election to the House of Representatives of Filipino citizens, who belong to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties; and who lack well-defined constituencies; but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole. The key words in this policy are “proportional representation,” “marginalized and underrepresented,” and “lack [of] well-defined constituencies.” “Proportional representation” here does not refer to the number of people in a particular district, because the party-list election is national in scope. Neither does it allude to numerical strength in a distressed or oppressed group. Rather, it refers to the representation of the “marginalized and underrepresented” as exemplified by the enumeration in Section 5 of the law; namely, “labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, elderly, handicapped, women, youth, veterans, overseas workers, and professionals.” However, it is not enough for the candidate to claim representation of the marginalized and underrepresented, because representation is easy to claim and to feign. The party-list organization or party must factually and truly represent the marginalized and underrepresented constituencies mentioned in Section 5. [36] Concurrently, the persons nominated by the party-list candidate-organization must be “Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties.” Finally, “lack of well-defined constituenc[y]” refers to the absence of a traditionally identifiable electoral group, like voters of a congressional district or territorial unit of government. Rather, it points again to those with disparate interests identified with the “marginalized or underrepresented.” In the end, the role of the Comelec is to see to it that only those Filipinos who are “marginalized and underrepresented” become members of Congress under the party-list system, Filipino-style. The intent of the Constitution is clear: to give genuine power to the people, not only by giving more law to those who have less in life, but more so by enabling them to become veritable lawmakers themselves. Consistent with this intent, the policy of the implementing law, we repeat, is likewise clear: “to enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, x x x, to become members of the House of Representatives.” Where the language of the law is clear, it must be applied according to its express terms. [37] The marginalized and underrepresented sectors to be represented under the party-list system are enumerated in Section 5 of RA 7941, which states: “SEC. 5. Registration . -- Any organized group of persons may register as a party, organization or coalition for purposes of the party-list system by filing with the COMELEC not later than ninety (90) days before the election a petition verified by its president or secretary stating its desire to participate in the party-list system as a national, regional or sectoral party or organization or a coalition of such parties or organizations, attaching thereto its constitution, by-laws, platform or program of government, list of officers, coalition agreement and other relevant information as the COMELEC may require: Provided , that the sector shall include labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, elderly, handicapped, women, youth, veterans, overseas workers, and professionals .” While the enumeration of marginalized and underrepresented sectors is not exclusive, it demonstrates the clear intent of the law that not all sectors can be represented under the party-list system. It is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that words employed in a statute are interpreted in connection with, and their meaning is ascertained by reference to, the words and the phrases with which they are associated or related. Thus, the meaning of a term in a statute may be limited, qualified or specialized by those in immediate association. [38] The Party-List System Desecrated by the OSG Contentions Notwithstanding the unmistakable statutory policy, the Office of the Solicitor General submits that RA No. 7941 “does not limit the participation in the party-list system to the marginalized and underrepresented sectors of society.” [39] In fact, it contends that any party or group that is not disqualified under Section 6 [40] of RA 7941 may participate in the elections. Hence, it admitted during the Oral Argument that even an organization representing the super rich of Forbes Park or Dasmariñas Village could participate in the party-list elections. [41] The declared policy of RA 7941 contravenes the position of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG). We stress that the party-list system seeks to enable certain Filipino citizens – specifically those belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties – to be elected to the House of Representatives. The assertion of the OSG that the party-list system is not exclusive to the marginalized and underrepresented disregards the clear statutory policy. Its claim that even the super-rich and overrepresented can participate desecrates the spirit of the party-list system. Indeed, the law crafted to address the peculiar disadvantages of Payatas hovel dwellers cannot be appropriated by the mansion owners of Forbes Park. The interests of these two sectors are manifestly disparate; hence, the OSG’s position to treat them similarly defies reason and common sense. In contrast, and with admirable candor, Atty. Lorna Patajo-Kapunan [42] admitted during the Oral Argument that a group of bankers, industrialists and sugar planters could not join the party-list system as representatives of their respective sectors. [43] While the business moguls and the mega-rich are, numerically speaking, a tiny minority, they are neither marginalized nor underrepresented, for the stark reality is that their economic clout engenders political power more awesome than their numerical limitation. Traditionally, political power does not necessarily emanate from the size of one’s constituency; indeed, it is likely to arise more directly from the number and amount of one’s bank accounts. It is ironic, therefore, that the marginalized and underrepresented in our midst are the majority who wallow in poverty, destitution and infirmity. It was for them that the party-list system was enacted -- to give them not only genuine hope, but genuine power; to give them the opportunity to be elected and to represent the specific concerns of their constituencies; and simply to give them a direct voice in Congress and in the larger affairs of the State. In its noblest sense, the party-list system truly empowers the masses and ushers a new hope for genuine change. Verily, it invites those marginalized and underrepresented in the past – the farm hands, the fisher folk, the urban poor, even those in the underground movement – to come out and participate, as indeed many of them came out and participated during the last elections. The State cannot now disappoint and frustrate them by disabling and desecrating this social justice vehicle. Because the marginalized and underrepresented had not been able to win in the congressional district elections normally dominated by traditional politicians and vested groups, 20 percent of the seats in the House of Representatives were set aside for the party-list system. In arguing that even those sectors who normally controlled 80 percent of the seats in the House could participate in the party-list elections for the remaining 20 percent, the OSG and the Comelec disregard the fundamental difference between the congressional district elections and the party-list elections. As earlier noted, the purpose of the party-list provision was to open up the system, [44] in order to enhance the chance of sectoral groups and organizations to gain representation in the House of Representatives through the simplest scheme possible. [45] Logic shows that the system has been opened to those who have never gotten a foothold within it -- those who cannot otherwise win in regular elections and who therefore need the “simplest scheme possible” to do so. Conversely, it would be illogical to open the system to those who have long been within it -- those privileged sectors that have long dominated the congressional district elections. The import of the open party-list system may be more vividly understood when compared to a student dormitory “open house,” which by its nature allows outsiders to enter the facilities. Obviously, the “open house” is for the benefit of outsiders only, not the dormers themselves who can enter the dormitory even without such special privilege. In the same vein, the open party-list system is only for the “outsiders” who cannot get elected through regular elections otherwise; it is not for the non-marginalized or overrepresented who already fill the ranks of Congress. Verily, allowing the non-marginalized and overrepresented to vie for the remaining seats under the party-list system would not only dilute , but also prejudice the chance of the marginalized and underrepresented, contrary to the intention of the law to enhance it. The party-list system is a tool for the benefit of the underprivileged; the law could not have given the same tool to others, to the prejudice of the intended beneficiaries. This Court, therefore, cannot allow the party-list system to be sullied and prostituted by those who are neither marginalized nor underrepresented. It cannot let that flicker of hope be snuffed out. The clear state policy must permeate every discussion of the qualification of political parties and other organizations under the party-list system. Refutation of the Separate Opinions The Separate Opinions of our distinguished colleagues, Justices Jose C. Vitug and Vicente V. Mendoza, are anchored mainly on the supposed intent of the framers of the Constitution as culled from their deliberations. The fundamental principle in constitutional construction, however, is that the primary source from which to ascertain constitutional intent or purpose is the language of the provision itself. The presumption is that the words in which the constitutional provisions are couched express the objective sought to be attained. [46] In other words, verba legis still prevails. Only when the meaning of the words used is unclear and equivocal should resort be made to extraneous aids of construction and interpretation, such as the proceedings of the Constitutional Commission or Convention, in order to shed light on and ascertain the true intent or purpose of the provision being construed. [47] Indeed, as cited in the Separate Opinion of Justice Mendoza, this Court stated in Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary [48] that “the debates and proceedings of the constitutional convention [may be consulted] in order to arrive at the reason and purpose of the resulting Constitution x x x only when other guides fail as said proceedings are powerless to vary the terms of the Constitution when the meaning is clear. Debates in the constitutional convention ‘are of value as showing the views of the individual members, and as indicating the reason for their votes, but they give us no light as to the views of the large majority who did not talk, much less of the mass or our fellow citizens whose votes at the polls gave that instrument the force of fundamental law. We think it safer to construe the constitution from what appears upon its face.’ The proper interpretation therefore depends more on how it was understood by the people adopting it than in the framers’ understanding thereof.” Section 5, Article VI of the Constitution, relative to the party-list system, is couched in clear terms: the mechanics of the system shall be provided by law . Pursuant thereto, Congress enacted RA 7941. In understanding and implementing party-list representation, we should therefore look at the law first. Only when we find its provisions ambiguous should the use of extraneous aids of construction be resorted to. But, as discussed earlier, the intent of the law is obvious and clear from its plain words. Section 2 thereof unequivocally states that the party-list system of electing congressional representatives was designed to “enable underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole x x x.” The criteria for participation is well defined. Thus, there is no need for recourse to constitutional deliberations, not even to the proceedings of Congress. In any event, the framers’ deliberations merely express their individual opinions and are, at best, only persuasive in construing the meaning and purpose of the constitution or statute. Be it remembered that the constitutionality or validity of Sections 2 and 5 of RA 7941 is not an issue here. Hence, they remain parts of the law, which must be applied plainly and simply. Fourth Issue: Grave Abuse of Discretion From its assailed Omnibus Resolution, it is manifest that the Comelec failed to appreciate fully the clear policy of the law and the Constitution. On the contrary, it seems to have ignored the facet of the party-list system discussed above. The OSG as its counsel admitted before the Court that any group, even the non-marginalized and overrepresented, could field candidates in the party-list elections. When a lower court, or a quasi-judicial agency like the Commission on Elections, violates or ignores the Constitution or the law, its action can be struck down by this Court on the ground of grave abuse of discretion. [49] Indeed, the function of all judicial and quasi-judicial instrumentalities is to apply the law as they find it, not to reinvent or second-guess it. [50] In its Memorandum, Petitioner Bayan Muna passionately pleads for the outright disqualification of the major political parties – Respondents Lakas-NUCD, LDP, NPC, LP and PMP – on the ground that under Comelec Resolution No. 4073, they have been accredited as the five (six, including PDP-Laban) major political parties in the May 14, 2001 elections. It argues that because of this, they have the “advantage of getting official Comelec Election Returns, Certificates of Canvass, preferred poll watchers x x x.” We note, however, that this accreditation does not refer to the party-list election, but, inter alia , to the election of district representatives for the purpose of determining which parties would be entitled to watchers under Section 26 of Republic Act No. 7166. What is needed under the present circumstances, however, is a factual determination of whether respondents herein and, for that matter, all the 154 previously approved groups, have the necessary qualifications to participate in the party-list elections, pursuant to the Constitution and the law. Bayan Muna also urges us to immediately rule out Respondent Mamamayan Ayaw sa Droga (MAD), because “it is a government entity using government resources and privileges.” This Court, however, is not a trier of facts. [51] It is not equipped to receive evidence and determine the truth of such factual allegations. Basic rudiments of due process require that respondents should first be given an opportunity to show that they qualify under the guidelines promulgated in this Decision, before they can be deprived of their right to participate in and be elected under the party-list system. Guidelines for Screening Party-List Participants The Court, therefore, deems it proper to remand the case to the Comelec for the latter to determine, after summary evidentiary hearings, whether the 154 parties and organizations allowed to participate in the party-list elections comply with the requirements of the law. In this light, the Court finds it appropriate to lay down the following guidelines, culled from the law and the Constitution, to assist the Comelec in its work. First, the political party, sector, organization or coalition must represent the marginalized and underrepresented groups identified in Section 5 of RA 7941. In other words, it must show -- through its constitution, articles of incorporation, bylaws, history, platform of government and track record -- that it represents and seeks to uplift marginalized and underrepresented sectors. Verily, majority of its membership should belong to the marginalized and underrepresented. And it must demonstrate that in a conflict of interests, it has chosen or is likely to choose the interest of such sectors. Second, while even major political parties are expressly allowed by RA 7941 and the Constitution to participate in the party-list system, they must comply with the declared statutory policy of enabling “Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors x x x to be elected to the House of Representatives.” In other words, while they are not disqualified merely on the ground that they are political parties, they must show, however, that they represent the interests of the marginalized and underrepresented. The counsel of Aksyon Demokratiko and other similarly situated political parties admitted as much during the Oral Argument, as the following quote shows: “JUSTICE PANGANIBAN: I am not disputing that in my question. All I am saying is, the political party must claim to represent the marginalized and underrepresented sectors? ATTY. KAPUNAN: Yes, Your Honor, the answer is yes.” [52] Third , in view of the objections [53] directed against the registration of Ang Buhay Hayaang Yumabong, which is allegedly a religious group, the Court notes the express constitutional provision that the religious sector may not be represented in the party-list system. The extent of the constitutional proscription is demonstrated by the following discussion during the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission: “MR. OPLE. x x x In the event that a certain religious sect with nationwide and even international networks of members and supporters, in order to circumvent this prohibition, decides to form its own political party in emulation of those parties I had mentioned earlier as deriving their inspiration and philosophies from well-established religious faiths, will that also not fall within this prohibition? MR. MONSOD. If the evidence shows that the intention is to go around the prohibition, then certainly the Comelec can pierce through the legal fiction.” [54] The following discussion is also pertinent: “MR. VILLACORTA. When the Commissioner proposed “EXCEPT RELIGIOUS GROUPS,” he is not, of course, prohibiting priests, imams or pastors who may be elected by, say, the indigenous community sector to represent their group. REV. RIGOS. Not at all, but I am objecting to anybody who represents the Iglesia ni Kristo, the Catholic Church, the Protestant Church et cetera.” [55] Furthermore, the Constitution provides that “religious denominations and sects shall not be registered.” [56] The prohibition was explained by a member [57] of the Constitutional Commission in this wise: “[T]he prohibition is on any religious organization registering as a political party. I do not see any prohibition here against a priest running as a candidate. That is not prohibited here; it is the registration of a religious sect as a political party.” [58] Fourth , a party or an organization must not be disqualified under Section 6 of RA 7941, which enumerates the grounds for disqualification as follows: “(1) It is a religious sect or denomination, organization or association organized for religious purposes; (2) It advocates violence or unlawful means to seek its goal; (3) It is a foreign party or organization; (4) It is receiving support from any foreign government, foreign political party, foundation, organization, whether directly or through any of its officers or members or indirectly through third parties for partisan election purposes; (5) It violates or fails to comply with laws, rules or regulations relating to elections; (6) It declares untruthful statements in its petition; (7) It has ceased to exist for at least one (1) year; or (8) It fails to participate in the last two (2) preceding elections or fails to obtain at least two per centum (2%) of the votes cast under the party-list system in the two (2) preceding elections for the constituency in which it has registered.” [59] Note should be taken of paragraph 5, which disqualifies a party or group for violation of or failure to comply with election laws and regulations. These laws include Section 2 of RA 7941, which states that the party-list system seeks to “enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties x x x to become members of the House of Representatives.” A party or an organization, therefore, that does not comply with this policy must be disqualified. Fifth , the party or organization must not be an adjunct of, or a project organized or an entity funded or assisted by, the government. By the very nature of the party-list system, the party or organization must be a group of citizens, organized by citizens and operated by citizens. It must be independent of the government. The participation of the government or its officials in the affairs of a party-list candidate is not only illegal [60] and unfair to other parties, but also deleterious to the objective of the law: to enable citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors and organizations to be elected to the House of Representatives. Sixth, the party must not only comply with the requirements of the law; its nominees must likewise do so. Section 9 of RA 7941 reads as follows: “SEC. 9. Qualifications of Party-List Nominees. – No person shall be nominated as party-list representative unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, a resident of the Philippines for a period of not less than one (1) year immediately preceding the day of the election, able to read and write, a bona fide member of the party or organization which he seeks to represent for at least ninety (90) days preceding the day of the election, and is at least twenty-five (25) years of age on the day of the election. In case of a nominee of the youth sector, he must at least be twenty-five (25) but not more than thirty (30) years of age on the day of the election. Any youth sectoral representative who attains the age of thirty (30) during his term shall be allowed to continue in office until the expiration of his term.” Seventh , not only the candidate party or organization must represent marginalized and underrepresented sectors; so also must its nominees. To repeat, under Section 2 of RA 7941, the nominees must be Filipino citizens “who belong to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties.” Surely, the interests of the youth cannot be fully represented by a retiree; neither can those of the urban poor or the working class, by an industrialist. To allow otherwise is to betray the State policy to give genuine representation to the marginalized and underrepresented. Eighth , as previously discussed, while lacking a well-defined political constituency, the nominee must likewise be able to contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole. Senator Jose Lina explained during the bicameral committee proceedings that “the nominee of a party, national or regional, is not going to represent a particular district x x x.” [61] Epilogue The linchpin of this case is the clear and plain policy of the law: “to enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole, to become members of the House of Representatives.” Crucial to the resolution of this case is the fundamental social justice principle that those who have less in life should have more in law. The party-list system is one such tool intended to benefit those who have less in life. It gives the great masses of our people genuine hope and genuine power. It is a message to the destitute and the prejudiced, and even to those in the underground, that change is possible. It is an invitation for them to come out of their limbo and seize the opportunity. Clearly, therefore, the Court cannot accept the submissions of the Comelec and the other respondents that the party-list system is, without any qualification, open to all. Such position does not only weaken the electoral chances of the marginalized and underrepresented; it also prejudices them. It would gut the substance of the party-list system. Instead of generating hope, it would create a mirage. Instead of enabling the marginalized, it would further weaken them and aggravate their marginalization. In effect, the Comelec would have us believe that the party-list provisions of the Constitution and RA 7941 are nothing more than a play on dubious words, a mockery of noble intentions, and an empty offering on the altar of people empowerment. Surely, this could not have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution and the makers of RA 7941. WHEREFORE, this case is REMANDED to the Comelec, which is hereby DIRECTED to immediately conduct summary evidentiary hearings on the qualifications of the party-list participants in the light of the guidelines enunciated in this Decision. Considering the extreme urgency of determining the winners in the last party-list elections, the Comelec is directed to begin its hearings for the parties and organizations that appear to have garnered such number of votes as to qualify for seats in the House of Representatives. The Comelec is further DIRECTED to submit to this Court its compliance report within 30 days from notice hereof. The Resolution of this Court dated May 9, 2001, directing the Comelec “to refrain from proclaiming any winner” during the last party-list election, shall remain in force until after the Comelec itself will have complied and reported its compliance with the foregoing disposition. This Decision is immediately executory upon the Commission on Elections’ receipt thereof. No pronouncement as to costs. SO ORDERED.

SEPARATE OPINION MENDOZA, J ., dissenting: I vote to dismiss the petitions in these cases. I will presently explain my vote, but before I do so it seems to me necessary to state briefly the facts and the issues. THE FACTS Petitioner Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party (OFW for short) is the political agency of the Overseas Filipino Workers Movement, a non-stock and non-profit organization. On the other hand, petitioner Bayan Muna is a political party representing peasants, workers, women, the youth, and other marginalized sectors. Both were accredited by the Commission on Elections in connection with the election for party-list representatives on May 14, 2001. Petitioners brought these suits ¾ in G.R. No. 147589, for certiorari and, in G.R. No. 147613, for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus ¾ for the purpose of seeking the annulment of the registration of the following parties classified as “political parties” and “organizations/coalitions” by the Commission on Elections: Political Parties : Partido ng Masang Pilipino (PMP), Lakas NUCD-UMDP (LAKAS NUCD-UMDP), Nationalist Peoples ’ Coalition (NPC), Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP), Aksyon Demokratiko (AKSYON), Partido Demokratiko Pilipino Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-LABAN), Liberal Party (LP), Nacionalista Party (NP), Ang Buhay Hayaang Yumabong Organizations/Coalitions : Citizens Drug Watch Foundation, Inc. (DRUG WATCH), Mamamayan Ayaw sa Droga (MAD), Go! Go! Philippines Movement (GO, GO PHILIPPINES), The True Marcos Loyalist (MARCOS LOYALIST), Philippine Local Autonomy Movement, Inc. (PLAM), Citizens Movement for Justice, Economy Environment and Peace (JEEP), Chamber of Real Estate Builders Association (CREBA), Sports and Health Advancement Foundation, Inc. (SHAF), Ang Lakas ng Overseas Contract Workers (OCW), Bagong Bayani Organization (BAGONG BAYANI), National Federation of Sugar Planters (NFSP) R.A. No. 7941, §5 provides that any party, organization, or coalition desiring to participate in the party-list system must apply to the COMELEC for registration not later than 90 days before the election. On the other hand, §4 of the same law requires that any party, organization, or coalition which is already registered with the COMELEC should declare its intention to participate in the party-list system 90 days before the election. In its Resolution No. 3785, dated March 26, 2001, the COMELEC passed upon the applications for registration or manifestations of intention of several parties, organizations, and coalitions. On March 28, 2001, it issued a certified list of parties, organizations, or coalitions entitled to participate in the May 14, 2001 elections. All in all, 148 parties, organizations, and coalitions were accredited, including private respondents herein. Petitioners OFW and Bayan Muna contend that the party-list system is exclusively for the “marginalized and underrepresented” sectors of the Philippine society and that there is no way by which other sectors not so identified, much less the major political parties, can participate in the party-list elections. Petitioner Bayan Muna in particular calls attention to the fact that seven of the respondent political parties (PMP, Lakas NUCD-UMDP, NPC, LDP, AKSYON, PDP-LABAN, and LP) are actually the major political parties in the country today as determined by the COMELEC in its Resolution No. 4073, dated May 3, 2001, and charges that the rest of private respondents are “pseudo party-list organizations” which are actually satellites of the major political parties and of big businesses. Bayan Muna argues that the party-list system is intended to address the problem of ineffective representation of underprivileged sectors of society and enhance direct people’s action and participation in the decision-making process to counter-balance the territorial representation of 80% of the House of Representatives, and that to allow participation in the party-list system of respondent political parties and parties/coalitions would be to defeat this purpose because these parties do not represent “marginalized and underrepresented” sectors. [1] For this reason, Bayan Muna prays that R.A. No. 7941, §11, par. 2 be declared unconstitutional on the ground that, by banning the five major political parties from participating in the party-list system only in the May 1998 elections, it leaves them free to participate in subsequent elections. On the other hand, the COMELEC argues: [B]oth the Constitution and the Party-List System Act clearly allow, and they do not prohibit, the participation of “registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations” to participate in the party-list system, whether or not said parties or organizations represent the marginalized and underrepresented sectors of society. [2] It cites the proviso of Art. VI, §5(2) of the Constitution that For three consecutive terms after the ratification of this Constitution, one-half of the seats allocated to party-list representatives shall be filled, as provided by law, by selection or election from the labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, women, youth, and such other sectors as may be provided by law, except the religious sector, as proof that “marginalized” sectors are not entitled to permanent seats in the House of Representatives. In any event, it is contended that petitioners’ recourse is not to this Court but to the COMELEC because whether a party, organization, or coalition represents “marginalized and underrepresented” sectors is a question of fact, and this Court is not a trier of facts. The COMELEC states that, as a matter of fact, petitioner Bayan Muna has pending petitions to disqualify, based on this ground, respondents NPC, LDP, PMP, LAKAS NUCD-UMDP, LP, MAD, CREBA, NFSP, JEEP, and BAGONG BAYANI. THE ISSUES The issues in these cases actually come down to the following: (1) Whether the petitions filed in these cases should be dismissed for failure of petitioners to exhaust administrative remedies in the COMELEC; and (2) Whether the party-list system is exclusively for “marginalized and underrepresented” sectors of society. We shall deal with these issues in the order they are stated. DISCUSSION I. While it is true that petitioner Bayan Muna has filed petitions for the disqualification of respondents, the fact is that when the petitions in these cases were filed on April 16 and 17, 2001, the elections were just a month away, and there was doubt whether a resolution of the petitions for disqualifications was forthcoming. In fact, up to the time of the elections on May 14, 2001, the cases were still unresolved. Petitioners, therefore, had no other “plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law” within the meaning of Rule 65, §§1-2 of the Code of Civil Procedure and were justified in resorting to the extraordinary remedies of certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus. From another point of view, there is no need for petitioners to await formal resolution of their petitions as the COMELEC had already indicated in press statements its stand that parties, organizations, or coalitions, whether or not representing “marginalized and underrepresented” sectors, could participate in the election for the party-list system — a fact confirmed by it in its comment and memorandum in these cases. There is thus no basis for insisting that petitioners should have exhausted administrative remedies before coming to this Court. Nor are the issues raised in these cases factual as the statement of the second issue above plainly shows. It is only if the question whether the party-list system is limited to “marginalized and underrepresented” sectors is answered in the affirmative will it be necessary to determine the status of respondents. II. At the core of the controversy in these cases is the following provision of the Constitution: Art. VI, §5(1). The House of Representatives shall be composed of not more than two hundred fifty members, unless otherwise fixed by law, who shall be elected from legislative districts apportioned among the provinces, cities, and the Metropolitan Manila area in accordance with the number of their respective inhabitants, and on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio, and those who, as provided by law, shall be elected through a party-list system of registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations. (2) The party-list representatives shall constitute twenty per centum of the total number of representatives including those under the party list. For three consecutive terms after the ratification of this Constitution, one-half of the seats allocated to party-list representatives shall be filled, as provided by law, by selection or election from the labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, women, youth, and such other sectors as may be provided by law except the religious sector. To carry out this provision of the Constitution, Congress enacted the Party-List System Act (R.A. No. 7941), the pertinent provisions of which read: SEC. 2. Declaration of Party. — The State shall promote proportional representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives through a party-list system of registered national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, which will enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole, to become members of the House of Representatives. Towards this end, the State shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives by enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature, and shall provide the simplest scheme possible. SEC. 11. Number of Party-List Representatives. —The party-list representatives shall constitute twenty per centum (20%) of the total number of the members of the House of Representatives including those under the party-list. For purposes of the May 1998 elections, the first five (5) major political parties on the basis of party representation in the House of Representatives at the start of the Tenth Congress of the Philippines shall not be entitled to participate in the party-list system. In determining the allocation of seats for the second vote, the following procedure shall be observed: (a) The parties, organizations, and coalitions shall be ranked from the highest to the lowest based on the number of votes they garnered during the elections. (b) The parties, organizations, and coalitions receiving at least two percent (2%) of the total votes cast for the party-list system shall be entitled to one seat each; Provided , That those garnering more than two percent (2%) of the votes shall be entitled to additional seats in proportion to their total number of votes: Provided, finally , That each party, organization, or coalition shall be entitled to not more than three (3) seats. “The most important single factor in determining the intention of the people from whom the Constitution emanated is the language in which it is expressed.” [3] The text of Art. VI, §5(1)(2) is quite clear. It provides for a party-list system of “registered, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations,” not for sectoral representation. Only for three consecutive terms following the ratification of the Constitution and only with respect to one-half of the seats allotted to party-list representatives does it allow sectoral representation. Textually, Art. VI, §5(1)(2) provides no basis for petitioners’ contention that whether it is sectoral representation or party-list system the purpose is to provide exclusive representation for “marginalized sectors,” by which term petitioners mean the labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, women, and youth sectors. Indeed, the two systems of representation are not identical. Party-list representation is a type of proportional representation designed to give those who otherwise cannot win a seat in the House of Representatives in district elections a chance to win if they have sufficient strength on a nationwide basis. (In this sense, these groups are considered “marginalized and underrepresented.”) Under the party-list system, representatives are elected from multi-seat districts in proportion to the number of votes received in contrast to the “winner-take-all” single-seat district in which, even if a candidate garners 49.9% of the votes, he gets no seat. Thus, under the party-list system, a party or candidate need not come in first in order to win seats in the legislature. On the other hand, in the “winner-take-all” single-seat district, the votes cast for a losing candidate are wasted as only those who vote for the winner are represented. To the extent then that it assures parties or candidates a percentage of seats in the legislature that reflects their public support, the party-list system enables marginalized and underrepresented sectors (such as, but not limited to, the labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, women, and youth sectors) to obtain seats in the House of Representatives. Otherwise, the party-list system does not guarantee to these sectors seats in the legislature. This is the method of representation adopted in the Constitution as answer to the problem of underrepresentation. In arguing that the party-list system is exclusively for the “marginalized and underrepresented sectors,” petitioner Bayan Muna argues that the constitutional intent in adopting the party-list system must be searched for in the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission. The polestar of constitutional interpretation has been stated by this Court in Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary , [4] as follows: While it is permissible in this jurisdiction to consult the debates and proceedings of the constitutional convention in order to arrive at the reason and purpose of the resulting Constitution, resort thereto may be had only when other guides fail as said proceedings are powerless to vary the terms of the Constitution when the meaning is clear. Debates in the constitutional convention “are of value as showing the views of the individual members, and as indicating the reason for their votes, but they give us no light as to the views of the large majority who did not talk, much less of the mass or our fellow citizens whose votes at the polls gave that instrument the force of fundamental law. We think it safer to construe the constitution from what appears upon its face.” The proper interpretation therefore depends more on how it was understood by the people adopting it than in the framers’ understanding thereof. It is worth recalling the celebrated comment of Charles P. Curtis, Jr. on the role of history in constitutional exegesis: The intention of the framers of the Constitution, even assuming we could discover what it was, when it is not adequately expressed in the Constitution, that is to say, what they meant when they did not say it, surely that has no binding force upon us. If we look behind or beyond what they set down in the document, prying into what else they wrote and what they said, anything we may find is only advisory. They may sit in at our councils. There is no reason why we should eavesdrop on theirs. [5] Be that as it may, the Record of the Constitutional Commission speaks clearly against petitioners’ reading of Art. VI, §5(1)(2). It shows clearly that the Constitutional Commission rejected sectoral representation in preference to proportional representation. As originally written, §5 of the Draft Article on the Legislative Department read: SEC. 5. The House of Representatives shall be composed of not more than two hundred and fifty members who shall be elected from legislative districts apportioned among the provinces and cities in accordance with the number of their respective inhabitants, and on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio, and those who, as provided by law, shall be elected from the sectors and party list. The sectoral or party list representatives shall in no case exceed twenty percent of the entire membership of the House of Representatives. Each legislative district shall comprise, as far as practicable, contiguous, compact and adjacent territory, provided, however, that each city with a population of more than two hundred thousand, or each province, shall have at least one representative. Within three years following the return of every census, the Congress shall make a reapportionment of legislative districts based on the standards provided in this section. [6] As petitioner Bayan Muna states, two proposals for additional representation in the House of Representatives were submitted by the Committee on Legislative Department: one for sectoral representation, advocated by Commissioner Villacorta, and another one for party-list system, advocated by Commissioner Monsod. The two are not the same. As Commissioner Monsod said in explaining his proposal: MR. MONSOD. . . . I would like to make a distinction from the beginning that the proposal for the party list system is not synonymous with that of the sectoral representation. Precisely, the party list system seeks to avoid the dilemma of choice of sectors and who constitute the members of the sectors. . . . In effect, a sectoral representation in the Assembly would mean that certain sectors would have reserved seats; that they will choose among themselves who would sit in those reserved seats. And then, we have the problem of which sector because as we will notice in Proclamation No. 9, the sectors cited were the farmers, fishermen, workers, students, professionals, business, military, academic, ethnic and other similar groups. So these are the nine sectors that were identified here as “sectoral representatives” to be represented in this Commission. The problem we had in trying to approach sectoral representation in the Assembly was whether to stop at these nine sectors or include other sectors. . . . Second, we had the problem of who comprise the farmers. . . . A doctor may be a farmer; a lawyer may also be a farmer. And so, it is up to the discretion of the person to say “I am a farmer” so he would be included in that sector. . . . Under the party list system, there are no reserved seats for sectors. . . . This can be a regional party, a sectoral party, a national party, UNIDO, Magsasaka or a regional party in Mindanao . One need not be a farmer to say that he wants the farmers’ party to be represented in the Assembly. Any citizen can vote for any party. At the end of the day, the COMELEC will then tabulate the votes that had been garnered by each party or each organization — one does not have to be a political party and register in order to participate as a party — and count the votes and from there derive the percentage of the votes that had been cast in favor of a party, organization or coalition. . . . . We feel that this approach gets around the mechanics of sectoral representation while at the same time making sure that those who really have a national constituency or sectoral constituency will get a chance to have a seat in the National Assembly. These sectors or these groups may not have the constituency to win a seat on a legislative district basis. They may not be able to win a seat on a district basis but surely, they will have votes on a nationwide basis. The purpose of this is to open the system. In the past elections, we found out that there were certain groups or parties that, if we count their votes nationwide, have about 1,000,000 or 1,500,000 votes. But they were always third place or fourth place in each of the districts. So, they have no voice in the Assembly. But this way, they would have five or six representatives in the Assembly even if they would not win individually in legislative districts. So, that is essentially the mechanics, the purpose and objectives of the party list system. [7] Commissioner Monsod, therefore, proposed to amend the phrase “shall be elected from the sectors and party list” in §5 by replacing it with the following THROUGH A PARTY LIST SYSTEM OF REGISTERED NATIONAL, REGIONAL OR SECTORAL PARTIES OR ORGANIZATIONS. [8] Attention should be paid to this proposal because with slight modification it later became the basis of the present Art. VI, §5(1)(2). The following exchange took place on the Monsod amendment: MR. DAVIDE: Madam President, before accepting the proposed amendment, the Committee would like to get some clarifications. When the proponent speaks of “OR SECTORAL PARTIES OR ORGANIZATIONS,” is he referring to any sector which the law may subsequently define? MR. MONSOD: . . . . The party list system that is being advocated by this amendment is a system that opens up the list to any regional, national or sectoral party. . . . . . . . MS. AQUINO. The Committee would like to be clarified on this. Do we understand the proponent correctly that this party list system is not necessarily synonymous to sectoral representation? MR. MONSOD: No, it is not necessarily synonymous, but it does include the right of sectoral parties or organizations to register, but it is not exclusive to sectoral parties or organizations . MS. AQUINO. And that it does not likewise reserve any institutional seat for any sector? In other words, it only enables it to be a part of the party list if it has the capacity to do so, but it does not reserve any seat for the sectors. MR. MONSOD. Yes, Madam President, this is not a reserve seat system. [9] The proposed amendment was opposed by a group headed by Commissioner Villacorta, which included Commissioners Tadeo, Lerum, and Bernas. Lerum said: MR. LERUM. Madam President, in view of the explanation, I am objecting to this amendment because it is possible that the labor sector will not be represented considering that those who will vote are all the voters of the Philippines. In other words, the representative of labor will be chosen by all the electors of the Philippines, and that is not correct. My contention is that the sectoral representative must be selected by his own constituents, and for that reason, I am objecting to this amendment. [10] On the other hand, Tadeo objected on the ground that if allowed to participate in the party-list system, the major political parties could gobble up the sectoral parties. He said: MR. TADEO. . . . . Kapag inilagay natin ang party list, papasukin ng political parties. Mangigibabaw at kakainin din niyan hanggang mawala ang sektor. [11] MR. TADEO. Ang punto lamang namin, pag pinayagan mo ang UNIDO na isang political party, it will dominate the party list at mawawalang saysay din iyong sector. Lalamunin mismo ng political parties ang party list system. Gusto ko lamang bigyan ng diin ang “reserve.” Hindi ito reserve seat sa marginalized sectors. Kung titingnan natin itong 198 seats, reserved din ito sa political parties. [12] Villacorta said he was objecting to the party-list system because it would not solve the problem of ineffective representation of the underprivileged sectors. He said: For too long since our people attained a semblance of self-government at the start of this century, our legislators were elected based on their promise that they would represent the little people of our land. With the exception of a few patriotic legislators, some of whom are in our Commission today, members of the National Assemblies, the Congresses, and the Batasans of the past did not devote themselves enough to the alleviation of the dismal condition of our country’s poor and lower classes. . . . . These realities convince us that there are no spokesmen and legislators who can best represent the poor, the underprivileged, the marginalized than those coming from within their ranks. [13] To Commissioner Villacorta, only reserved seats for the sectors would give them effective representation: MR. MONSOD. My amendment merely says that it is THROUGH A PARTY LIST SYSTEM OF REGISTERED NATIONAL, REGIONAL OR SECTORAL PARTIES OR ORGANIZATIONS. My question is: Does the Honorable Commissioner object to this amendment? MR. VILLACORTA. Yes, because it does not guarantee that the seats reserved for the party list representatives will be reserved for the sectors. [14] Because of the impasse, the discussion on Friday, July 25, 1986, on §5 was suspended to allow the commissioners to come to an agreement. After one week, a compromise formula was reached by the two groups and presented to the plenary session of the Commission on August 1, 1986. In lieu of the phrase “shall be elected from the sectors and the party list,” it was proposed that the following be inserted in §5 of the Draft Article: THROUGH A PARTY LIST SYSTEM OF REGISTERED NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND SECTORAL PARTIES OR ORGANIZATIONS AS PROVIDED BY LAW. THE PARTY LIST REPRESENTATIVES SHALL CONSTITUTE TWENTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PROVIDED THAT FOR THE FIRST TWO TERMS AFTER THE RATIFICATION OF THIS CONSTITUTION TWENTY-FIVE OF THE SEATS ALLOCATED TO PARTY LIST REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE FILLED BY SELECTION OR ELECTION, AS PROVIDED BY LAW FROM THE LABOR, PEASANT, URBAN POOR AND YOUTH SECTORS. However, although an agreement had apparently been reached, the advocates of sectoral representation were not satisfied that it would be allowed only for two terms and only with respect to one-half of the seats allocated for party-list representatives. Commissioner Aquino proposed instead the following amendment of §5: ELECTED THROUGH A PARTY LIST SYSTEM OF REGISTERED NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND SECTORAL PARTIES OR ORGANIZATIONS, AS PROVIDED BY LAW. THE PARTY LIST REPRESENTATIVES SHALL CONSTITUTE TWENTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. TWENTY-FIVE OF THE SEATS ALLOCATED TO PARTY LIST REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE FILLED BY ELECTION, AS PROVIDED BY LAW, FROM THE LABOR, PEASANT, URBAN POOR, WOMEN AND YOUTH SECTORS When put to vote, however, Aquino’s proposal was defeated with nineteen (19) voting in favor, and twenty-two (22) voting against. [15] The Commission then voted on the proposed amendment of Commissioner Monsod. With only a few minor changes, it was approved by a vote of thirty-two (32) commissioners against none. [16] As finally worded, the amendment reads: SHALL BE FILLED AS PROVIDED BY LAW, BY SELECTION OR ELECTION, FROM THE LABOR, PEASANT, URBAN POOR, INDIGENOUS CULTURAL COMMUNITIES, WOMEN, YOUTH, AND SUCH OTHER SECTORS AS MAY BE PROVIDED BY LAW, EXCEPT THE RELIGIOUS SECTOR Thus, the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission show that the party-list system is not limited to the “marginalized and underrepresented” sectors referred to by petitioners, i.e., labor, peasants, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, women, and the youth, but that it is a type of proportional representation intended to give voice to those who may not have the necessary number to win a seat in a district but are sufficiently numerous to give them a seat nationwide. It, therefore, misreads the debates on Art. VI, §5(1)(2) to say that “Although Commissioners Villacorta and Monsod differed in their proposals as to the details of the party-list system, both proponents worked within the framework that the party-list system is for the ‘marginalized’ as termed by Comm. Villacorta and the ‘underrepresented’ as termed by Comm. Monsod, which he defined as those which are ‘always third or fourth place in each of the districts.’” [17] Indeed, the two proposals put forth by them are basically different, and they do not have the same basis. What the advocates of sectoral representation wanted was permanent reserved seats for “marginalized sectors” by which they mean the labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, women, and youth sectors. Under Art. VI, §5(2), these sectors were given only one-half of the seats in the House of Representatives and only for three terms. On the other hand, the “third or fourth place(rs)” in district elections, for whom the party-list system was intended, refer to those who may not win seats in the districts but nationwide may be sufficiently strong to enable them to be represented in the House. They may include Villacorta’s “marginalized” or “underprivileged” sectors, but they are not limited to them. There would have been no need to give the “marginalized sectors” one-half of the seats for the party-list system for three terms if the two systems are identical. The objections raised against the accreditation of private respondents are the same ones raised by Commissioners Villacorta, Tadeo, and Lerum, among others, to the Monsod proposal which became the present Art. VI, §5(1)(2), namely, that certain sectors, like labor, may not win seats in the House under the party-list system; that the big parties might gobble up the sectoral parties; that the party-list system will not solve the problem of ineffective representation of the “underprivileged sectors.” These objections, however, did not carry the day, as the members of the Constitutional Commission voted 32-0 in favor of the Monsod proposal. It is noteworthy that even those who spoke against the Monsod proposal did not vote against it. To uphold these objections now would be to overrule the Constitutional Commission and in effect amend the Constitution. In sum, a problem was placed before the Constitutional Commission that the existing “winner-take-all” one-seat district system of election leaves blocks of voters underrepresented. To this problem of underrepresentation two solutions were proposed: sectoral representation and party-list system or proportional representation. The Constitutional Commission chose the party-list system. This Court cannot hold that the party-list system is reserved for the labor, peasants, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, women, and youth as petitioners contend without changing entirely the meaning of the Constitution which in fact mandates exactly the opposite of the reserved seats system when it provides in Art. IX,C, §6 that “A free and open party system shall be allowed to evolve according to the free choice of the people, subject to the provisions of this Article.” Thus, neither textual nor historical consideration yields support for the view that the party-list system is designed exclusively for labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, women, and youth sectors. As Commissioner Ople said in supporting the Monsod proposal: In my opinion, this will also create the stimulus for political parties and mass organizations to seek common ground. For example, we have the PDP-Laban and the UNIDO. I see no reason why they should not be able to make common goals with mass organizations so that the very leadership of these parties can be transformed through the participation of mass organizations. And if this is true of the administration parties, this will be true of others like the Partido ng Bayan which is now being formed. There is no question that they will be attractive to many mass organizations. In the opposition parties to which we belong, there will be a stimulus for us to contact mass organizations so that with their participation, the policies of such parties can be radically transformed because this amendment will create conditions that will challenge both the mass organizations and the political parties to come together. And the party list system is certainly available, although it is open to all the parties. It is understood that the parties will enter in the roll of the COMELEC the names of representatives of mass organizations affiliated with them. So that we may, in time, develop this excellent system that they have in Europe where labor organizations and cooperatives, for example, distribute themselves either in the Social Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Party in Germany, and their very presence there has a transforming effect upon the philosophies and the leadership of those parties. [18] With respect to the cancellation of any party registered under the party-list system, §6 of the Party-List System Act provides: SEC. 6. Refusal and/or Cancellation of Registration . — The COMELEC may, motu proprio or upon verified complaint of any interested party, refuse or cancel, after due notice and hearing, the registration of any national, regional or sectoral party, organization or coalition on any of the following grounds: (1) It is a religious sect or denomination, organization or association organized for religious purposes; (2) It advocates violence or unlawful means to seek its goal; (3) It is a foreign party or organization; (4) It is receiving support from any foreign government, foreign political party, foundation, organization, whether directly or through any of its officers or members or indirectly through third parties for partisan election purposes; (5) It violates or fails to comply with laws, rules or regulations relating to elections; (6) It declares untruthful statements in its petition; (7) It has ceased to exist for at least one (1) year; or (8) It fails to participate in the last two (2) preceding elections or fails to obtain at least two per centum (2%) of the votes cast under the party-list system in the two (2) preceding elections for the constituency in which it has registered. Petitioners’ allegations that certain parties or organizations, such as private respondents MAD and Ang Buhay Hayaang Yumabong, are disqualified under this provision are for the COMELEC to determine after due notice and hearing. They are unfit for resolution in these proceedings. III. On the other hand, the majority states: The presumption is that the words in which the constitutional provisions are couched express the objective sought to be attained. In other words, verba legis still prevails. Only when the meaning of the words used is unclear and equivocal should resort be made to extraneous aids of construction and interpretation, such as the proceedings of the Constitutional Commission or Convention, in order to shed light on and ascertain the true intent or purpose of the provision being construed. . . . . Section 5, Article VI of the Constitution, relative to the party-list system, is couched in clear terms: the mechanics of the system shall be provided by law . Pursuant thereto, Congress enacted RA 7941. . . . Section 2 thereof unequivocally states that the party-list system of electing congressional representatives was designed to “enable underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole . . .” With due respect, I think the majority misapprehends the meaning of §2 of R.A. No. 7941. The provision reads: SEC. 2. Declaration of Party. — The State shall promote proportional representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives through a party-list system of registered national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, which will enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole, to become members of the House of Representatives. Towards this end, the State shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives by enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature, and shall provide the simplest scheme possible. What this provision simply states is that the purpose of the party-list system is to promote proportional representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives and, that to achieve this end, “a full, free and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives” shall be guaranteed. Contrary to what the majority claims, §2 does not say that the party-list system is intended “ to enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations, and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation” to win seats in the House of Representatives. What it says is that the policy of the law is “to promote proportional representation through a party-list system of registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, which will enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations, and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation” to win seats in the House. For while the representation of “marginalized and underrepresented” sectors is a basic purpose of the law, it is not its only purpose. As already explained, the aim of proportional representation is to enable those who cannot win in the “winner-take-all” district elections a chance of winning. These groups are not necessarily limited to the sectors mentioned in §5, i.e ., labor, peasants, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, the elderly, the handicapped, women, the youth, veterans, overseas workers, and professionals. These groups can possibly include other sectors. Indeed, how can there be a “full, free and open party system” if the election for the party list system is to be limited to the sectors which are enumerated in §5 of the law, i.e., labor, peasants, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, the elderly, handicapped, women, the youth, veterans, overseas workers, and professionals? After all, what is provided for is “a party-list system of registered national , regional , and sectoral parties or organizations” each of which is separately defined in §3 of the law. That the party-list system is not limited to these groups is also clear from §5 of the law: SEC. 5. Registration . - Any organized group of persons may register as a party, organization or coalition for purposes of the party-list system by filing with the COMELEC not later than ninety (90) days before the election a petition verified by its president or secretary stating its desire to participate in the party-list system as a national, regional or sectoral party or organization or a coalition of such parties or organizations, attaching thereto its constitution, bylaws, platform or program of government, list of officers, coalition agreement and other relevant information as the COMELEC may require: Provided , That the sectors shall include labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor indigenous cultural communities, elderly, handicapped, women, youth, veterans, overseas workers, and professionals. There would be no need to provide specifically for the sectors if the party-list system is reserved for them. FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, the petitions in these cases should be dismissed.

SEPARATE (DISSENTING) OPINION VITUG, J .: The 1987 Constitution, crafted at a time when the euphoria of the 1986 People Power had barely subsided, recognized the vigor infused by civilian society in a cleansing political reform and focused itself on institutionalizing civilian participation in daily governance. A cause for concern was the not-too-unlikely perpetuation of a single party in power- a convenient contrivance for authoritarian rule. Article VI, Section 5, subsection 2, of the 1987 Charter - THE PARTY-LIST REPRESENTATIVES SHALL CONSTITUTE TWENTY PER CENTUM OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES INCLUDING THOSE UNDER THE PARTY LIST FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE TERMS. AFTER THE RATIFICATION OF THIS CONSTITUTION, ONE-HALF OF THE SEATS ALLOCATED TO PARTY-LIST REPRESENTATIVE SHALL BE FILLED, AS PROVIDED BY LAW, BY SELECTION OR ELECTION FROM THE LABOR, PEASANT, URBAN POOR, INDIGENOUS CULTURAL COMMUNITIES, WOMEN, YOUTH, AND SUCH OTHER SECTORS AS MAY BE PROVIDED BY LAW, EXCEPT THE RELIGIOUS SECTOR. - was the result of long-drawn deliberations and compromises. Immediately, after the resumption of the next Congress, then president Corazon C. Aquino, exercising her transitory appointing powers, assigned to the reserved seats in the Lower House, representatives of the labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, women and youth sector. The assignment was made from a selected list of names submitted by the sectors themselves. The sectors would continue to enjoy these reserved seats for the next three terms; thenceforth, they would have to participate in an electoral contest to secure their representation in Congress. Article 6, Section 5(2), however, not being self-executing, would wait for the legislature to ordain the enabling law. Congress was to be circumscribed by the terms expressed in Article 6, Section 5(2). - First , the system should only apply to the election of 20% of the total composition of the House of Representatives, second, it would prescribe a mandatory proportional representation scheme, and, third, it would allow participating parties and organizations to be represented in voter's registration boards, board of election inspectors, parties and organizations or similar entities. On 03 March 1995, Republic Act 7941, also known as ""An Act Providing for the Election of Party-List Representatives Through the Party- List System, and Appropriating Funds Therefor,"" was enacted. The enabling law laid the basis for COMELEC Resolution No.2847, issued on July 1996, prescribing the ""Rules and Regulations Governing the Elections of the Party-List Representatives through the Party-List System."" In the May 1998 first party-list elections, the sectors were required, to test, for the first time, their political mettle in an open electoral contest with other parties, groups and organizations under a party-list system. While the elections had a low-voter turnout, seen largely as a result of public unawareness of an electoral innovation, the recent 2001 multi-party list elections, however, were different. This time, a huge number of parties, groups and coalitions applied for registration with, and subsequently obtained accreditation from, the COMELEC. Six of these groups were established political parties, namely PARTIDO NG MASANG PILIPINO, LAKAS NUCD-UMDP, NATIONALIST PEOPLE'S COALITION, LABAN NG DEMOKRATIKONG PILIPINO, AKSYON DEMOKRATIKO, LIBERAL PARTY, NACIONALISTA PARTY and PDP-LABAN. The instant petition prays for the exclusion of these major parties on the ground that their participation does not level the playing field for less known and less organized sectoral groups still in dire need of election logistics and machinery. Arguing that the system is open to the underrepresented and marginalized sectors, as well as other parties but only on the condition that the latter field sectoral candidates themselves, herein petitioner sought the disqualification of the large major political parties and groups which do not represent any ""genuine"" sectoral interest. A perusal of the novel electoral engineering, introduced by the Constitution into the electoral system, would show the pertinent provisions to be stoically quiet on the qualifications of a party, group or coalition to participate under the party-list system. Instead, it has opted to rely on a subsequent statutory enactment to provide for the system's focal particulars, which now lead us to the enabling law itself. Section 2 of R.A. 7941 reads - ""The State shall promote proportional representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives through a party-list system of registered national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, which will enable the Filipino citizens belonging to the marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lacked well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole, to become members of the House of Representatives. Towards this end, the State shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives, by enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature, and shall provide the simplest scheme possible."" The draft provisions on what was to become Article VI, Section 5, subsection (2), of the 1987 Constitution took off from two staunch positions - the first headed by Commissioner Villacorta, advocating that of the 20 percentum of the total seats in Congress to be allocated to party-list representatives half were to be reserved to appointees from the marginalized and underrepresented sectors. The proposal was opposed by some Commissioners. Mr. Monsod expressed the difficulty in delimiting the sectors that needed representation. He was of the view that reserving seats for the marginalized and underrepresented sectors would stunt their development into full-pledged parties equipped with electoral machinery potent enough to further the sectoral interests to be represented. The Villacorta group, on the other hand, was apprehensive that pitting the unorganized and less-moneyed sectoral groups in an electoral contest would be like placing babes in the lion's den, so to speak, with the bigger and more established political parties ultimately gobbling them up. R.A. 7941 recognized this concern when it banned the first five major political parties on the basis of party representation in the House of Representatives from participating in the party-list system for the first party-list elections held in 1998 (and to be automatically lifted starting with the 2001 elections). The advocates for permanent seats for sectoral representatives made an effort towards a compromise - that the party-list system be open only to underrepresented and marginalized sectors. This proposal was further whittled down by allocating only half of the seats under the party-list system to candidates from the sectors which would garner the required number of votes. The majority was unyielding. Voting 19-22, the proposal for permanent seats, and in the alternative the reservation of the party-list system to the sectoral groups, was voted down. The only concession the Villacorta group was able to muster was an assurance of reserved seats for selected sectors for three consecutive terms after the enactment of the 1987 Constitution, by which time they would be expected to gather and solidify their electoral base and brace themselves in the multi-party electoral contest with the more veteran political groups. The system, designed to accommodate as many groups as possible, abhors the monopoly of representation in the Lower House. This intent is evident in the statutory imposition of the three-seat cap, which prescribes the limit to the number of seats that may be gained by a party or organization. [1] Votes garnered in excess of 6% of the total votes cast do not entitle the party to more than three seats. There is no express provision of the Constitution or in the enabling law that disallows major political parties from participating in the party-list system and, at the same time, from fielding candidates for legislative district representatives. Perhaps the present controversy stems from a confusion of the actual character of the party-list system. At first glance, it gives the impression of being a combination of proportional representation for non-traditional parties and sectoral representation. The first, proportional representation, on one end, is intended for no other reason than to open up the electoral process for broader participation and representation. Sectoral representation on the other, presupposes that every underrepresented sector be represented in Congress. This impression of sectoral-based representation stems from the provisions of Article 6, Section 5(2), of the Constitution, as well as R.A. 7941, in enumerating specific sectors to be represented. In holding that the party list system is open only to the underrepresented and marginalized sectors, the ponencia places much reliance on Section 5 of R.A. 7941: ""SEC. 5. Registration . Any organized group of persons may register as a party, organization or coalition for purposes of the party-list system by filing with the COMELEC not later than ninety (90) days before the election a petition verified by its president or secretary stating its desire to participate in the party-list system as a national, regional or sectoral party or organization or a coalition of such parties or organizations, attaching thereto its constitution, bylaws, platform or program of government, list of officers, coalition agreement and other relevant information as the COMELEC may require: Provided , That the sectors shall include labor peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, elderly, handicapped, women, youth, veterans, overseas workers, and professionals. ""The COMELEC shall publish the petition in at least two (2) national newspapers of general circulation. ""The COMELEC shall, after due notice and hearing, resolve the petition within fifteen (15) days from the date it was submitted for decision but in no case not later than sixty (60) days before election."" It would seem to me that, construed along with Section 3(d) of the statute, defining a ""sectoral party,"" the enumeration was intended to qualify only ""sectoral parties"" and not the other eligible groups (e.g., political parties, sectoral organizations and coalitions). Neither Article 6, Section 5(2), nor R.A. 7941 intended to guarantee representation to all sectors of society and, let alone, hand it over only to underrepresented and marginalized sectors. The real aim, if the will of the majority of the Commissioners were to be respected, was to introduce the concept of party-list representation. The party-list system is limited to four groups - 1) political parties, 2) sectoral parties, 3) sectoral organizations, and 4) coalitions. A political party is an organized group of citizens advocating an ideology, or platform, principles or policies for the general conduct of government and which, as the most immediate means of securing their adoption, regularly nominate and supports certain of its leaders and members as candidates for public office. A sectoral party is an organized group of citizens belonging to identifiable sectors, such as those enumerated in Article 6, Section 5(2), of the 1987 Constitution, which includes the labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities and women and those added by R.A. 7941 like the fisherfolk, elderly, handicapped, veterans, overseas workers and professionals. A sectoral organization is a group of citizens who share the same or similar attributes or characteristics, employment, interests or concerns. Coalition is an aggrupation of duly registered national, regional, sectoral parties or organizations for election purposes. A party or organization desiring to join the party-list system is required to register with the COMELEC, together with a list of its five nominees for party-list representatives, arranged according to the group's order of preference. In every election for the House of Representatives, each voter casts two votes - one for the district representative of his choice and another for the party or organization of his choice. The votes cast for the parties and organizations are totaled nationwide. In contrast to the election of all other officials where the rule of plurality (i.e., the candidate with the highest number of votes wins) is adopted, the number of seats under the party-list system depends on the number of votes received in proportion to the total number of votes cast nationwide. On the basis of the number of registered voters in the recent elections, a group under the party-list system, should get approximately half a million votes to be entitled to one seat. At the center stage of this controversy are the political parties themselves. Undeniably, political parties are an important feature in both democratic and authoritarian regimes. By legitimizing the individuals and institutions that control political power, parties add an important element of stability to a political system and also help organize the government and electorate by recruiting candidates, conducting campaigns, encouraging partisan attachments and generally educating the public, stimulating voter participation and providing varying degrees of policy direction to government. The idea could also be seen as a good training and recruiting ground for potential leaders. Advocates commend the multi-party as allowing the expression and the compromise of the many interests of a complex society, including a range of ideological differences, conflicting political values and philosophies. Section 6 of the 1987 Constitution is explicit - ""A free and open party system shall be allowed to evolve according to the free choice of the people."" [2] The multi-party system of proportional representation broadens the composition of the House of Representatives to accommodate sectors and organizations that do not have well-defined political constituencies and to facilitate access to minority or small parties. A party-list nominee is subject to basically the same qualifications applicable to legislative districts candidates, [3] with the exception of the additional requirement that he be nominated in one list only, and provided, further, that he is not a candidate for any elective office or has lost his bid for an elective office in the immediately preceding election. [4] A nominee must actually belong to the sector which they purport to represent, otherwise, there can be no true representation. [5] A nominee of the youth sector is further required to be at least 25 but not more than 30 years of age on the day of the election. [6] Should he, however, attain the age of 30 during his term, he is allowed to continue until the expiration thereof. [7] Once elected, party-list representatives also enjoy the same term, rights and privileges as do district representatives, except that they are not entitled to the Country-wide Development Fund (CDF). [8] A feature of the party-list system is that political parties, sectoral groups and organizations, coalitions and aggrupation acquire the status of ""candidates"" and their nominees relegated to mere agents. Thus, if a party-list representative dies, becomes physically incapacitated, removed from office by the party or the organization he represents, resigns, or is disqualified during his term, his party can send another person to take his place for the remaining period, provided the replacement is next in succession in the list of nominees submitted to the COMELEC upon registration. Furthermore, a party-list representative who switches party affiliations during his term forfeits his seat. [9] So, also, if a person changes his sectoral affiliation within 6 months before the election, he will not be eligible for nomination in party-list representative under his new party or organization. [10] The argument raised by petitioners could not be said to have been overlooked as they precisely were the same points subjected to intense and prolonged deliberations by the members of the Constitutional Commission. And, the polestar in the constructions of constitutions always remains --- ""effect must be given to the intent of the framers of the organic law and of the people adopting it."" [11] The law, in its clear formulation cannot give this tribunal the elbow-room for construction. Courts are bound to suppose that any inconveniences involved in the application of constitutional provisions according to their plain terms and import have been considered in advance and accepted as less intolerable than those avoided, or as compensated by countervailing advantages. [12] The ponencia itself, in ruling as it does, may unwittingly, be crossing the limits of judicial review and treading the dangerous waters of judicial legislation, and more importantly, of a constitutional amendment. While, the lament of herein petitioners is understandable, the remedy lies not with this Court but with the people themselves through an amendment of their work as and when better counsel prevails. WHEREFORE, I regret my inability to concur with my colleagues in their judgment. I am thus constrained to vote for the dismissal of the petitions. [1] Section 11(b), R.A. 7941. [2] Bernas, pp. 355-358. [3] The Constitutional qualifications for legislative districts representatives apply to party-list nominees - Section 6, Article 6, 1987 Constitution. No person shall be a member of the House of Representatives unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, and on the day of the election, at lest twenty-five years of age, able to read and write, and except the party-list representative, a registered voter in the district in which he shall be elected, and a resident thereof for a period not less than one year immediately preceding the day of the elections.

No. 134958. January 31, 2001 ] PATRICIO CUTARAN, DAVID DANGWAS AND PACIO DOSIL, PETITIONERS, VS. DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES, HEREIN REPRESENTED BY SEC. VICTOR O. RAMOS, OSCAR M. HAMADA AND GUILLERMO S. FIANZA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF COMMUNITY SPECIAL TASK FORCE ON ANCESTRAL LANDS (CSTFAL), BAGUIO CITY, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N GONZAGA-REYES, J.: Before us is a petition for review of the decision rendered by the Court of Appeals on March 25, 1998 and the order dated August 5, 1998 in CA-G.R SP No. 43930, a petition for prohibition originally filed with the appellate court to enjoin the respondent DENR from implementing DENR Special Order Nos. 31, as amended by 31-A and 31-B, series of 1990, Special Order No. 25, series of 1993 and all other administrative issuances relative thereto, for having been issued without prior legislative authority. In 1990 the Assistant Secretary for Luzon Operations of the DENR issued Special Order no. 31 [1] entitled ""Creation of a Special Task force on acceptance, identification, evaluation and delineation of ancestral land claims in the Cordillera Administrative Region"". The special task force created thereunder was authorized to accept and evaluate and delineate ancestral land claims within the said area, and after due evaluation of the claims, to issue appropriate land titles (Certificate of Ancestral Land Claim) in accordance with existing laws. [2] On January 15, 1993 the Secretary of the DENR issued Special Order no. 25 [3] entitled ""Creation of Special Task Forces provincial and community environment and natural resources offices for the identification, delineation and recognition of ancestral land claims nationwide"" and Department Administrative Order no. 02, [4] containing the Implementing Rules and Guidelines of Special Order no. 25. In 1990, the same year Special Order no. 31 was issued, the relatives of herein petitioners filed separate applications for certificate of ancestral land claim (CALC) over the land they, respectively occupy inside the Camp John Hay Reservation. In 1996 the applications were denied by the DENR Community Special Task Force on Ancestral Lands on the ground that the Bontoc and Applai tribes to which they belong are not among the recognized tribes of Baguio City. Also pursuant to the assailed administrative issuances the Heirs of Apeng Carantes filed an application [5] for certification of ancestral land claim over a parcel of land also within Camp John Hay and overlapping some portions of the land occupied by the petitioners. Petitioners claim that even if no certificate of ancestral land claim has yet been issued by the DENR in favor of the heirs of Carantes, the latter, on the strength of certain documents issued by the DENR, tried to acquire possession of the land they applied for, including the portion occupied by herein petitioners. Petitioners also allege that the heirs of Carantes removed some of the improvements they introduced within the area they actually occupy and if not for the petitioner's timely resistance to such intrusions, the petitioners would have been totally evicted therefrom. Hence, this petition for prohibition originally filed with the Court of Appeals to enjoin the respondent DENR from implementing the assailed administrative issuances and from processing the application for certificate of ancestral land claim (CALC) filed by the heirs of Carantes on the ground that the said administrative issuances are void for lack of legal basis. The Court of Appeals [6] held that the assailed DENR Special Orders Nos. 31, 31-A, 31-B issued in 1990 prior to the effectivity of RA 7586 known as the National Integrated Protected Areas Systems (NIPAS) Act of 1992, are of no force and effect ""for pre-empting legislative prerogative"" but sustained the validity of DENR Special Order No. 25, and its implementing rules (DAO No. 02, series of 1993) by the appellate court on the ground that they were issued pursuant to the powers delegated to the DENR under section 13 of RA 7586, which reads: ""Section 13. Ancestral Lands and Rights over Them.- Ancestral lands and customary rights and interest arising therefrom shall be accorded due recognition. The DENR shall prescribe rules and regulations to govern ancestral lands within protected areas: Provided, that the DENR shall have no power to evict indigenous communities from their present occupancy nor resettle them to another area without their consent: Provided, however, that all rules and regulations, whether adversely affecting said communities or not, shall be subjected to notice and hearing to be participated in by members of concerned indigenous community."" [7] The petitioners filed with this Court a petition for review of the appellate court's decision on the ground that the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the validity of Special Order No. 25 and its implementing rules. The petitioners seek to enjoin the respondent DENR from processing the application for certificate of ancestral land claim filed by the Heirs of Carantes. Petitioners contend that in addition to the failure of the DENR to publish the assailed administrative issuances in a newspaper of general circulation prior to its implementation, RA 7586, which provides for the creation of a National Integrated Protected Areas System, does not contain the slightest implication of a grant of authority to the DENR to adjudicate or confer title over lands occupied by indigenous communities. It is contended that the said law only grants DENR administrative and managerial powers over designated national and natural parks called ""protected areas"" wherein rare and endangered species of plants and animals inhabit. [8] The petitioners further allege that the subsequent passage of in 1997 of Republic Act 8371, otherwise known as the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act, wherein the power to evaluate and issue certificates of ancestral land titles is vested in the National Commission on Indigenous Cultural Communities/ Indigenous People (NCIP) is unmistakable indication of the legislature's withholding of authority from the DENR to confer title over lands occupied by indigenous communities. [9] Finally, the petitioners claim that the validity of the questioned DENR special orders cannot be based on the constitutional provisions regarding the protection of cultural communities as the said provisions are policy statements to guide the legislature in the exercise of their law-making powers and by themselves are not self-executory. The Solicitor-General filed memorandum in behalf of the respondent DENR praying for the affirmance of the appellate court's decision. The respondent argues that the subject DENR special orders were issued pursuant to the powers granted by RA 7586 to the DENR to protect the socio-economic interests of indigenous peoples . The land occupied by the petitioners is within a ""protected area"" as defined by the said law and is well within the jurisdiction of the DENR. The respondent likewise claims that the petitioners are estopped from contesting the validity of the DENR administrative issuances considering that their relatives applied for certificates of ancestral land claim (CALC) under the said special orders which applications were, however, denied. The petitioners should not be allowed to challenge the same administrative orders which they themselves previously invoked. The respondents do not contest the ruling of the appellate court as regards the nullity of Special Order no. 31, as amended. The sole issue before us concerns the validity of DENR Special Order no. 25, series of 1993 and its implementing rules DAO no. 02. The petitioners' main contention is that the assailed administrative orders were issued beyond the jurisdiction or power of the DENR secretary under the NIPAS Act of 1992. They seek to enjoin the respondents from processing the application for ancestral land claim filed by the heirs of Carantes because if approved, the petitioners may be evicted from the portion of the land they occupy which overlaps the land applied for by the Carantes heirs. From a reading of the records it appears to us that the petition was prematurely filed. Under the undisputed facts there is as yet no justiciable controversy for the court to resolve and the petition should have been dismissed by the appellate court on this ground. We gather from the allegations of the petition and that of the petitioners' memorandum that the alleged application for certificate of ancestral land claim (CALC) filed by the heirs of Carantes under the assailed DENR special orders has not been granted nor the CALC applied for, issued. The DENR is still processing the application of the heirs of Carantes for a certificate of ancestral land claim, which the DENR may or may not grant. It is evident that the adverse legal interests involved in this case are the competing claims of the petitioners and that of the heirs of Carantes to possess a common portion of a piece of land. As the undisputed facts stand there is no justiciable controversy between the petitioners and the respondents as there is no actual or imminent violation of the petitioners' asserted right to possess the land by reason of the implementation of the questioned administrative issuances. A justiciable controversy has been defined as, "" a definite and concrete dispute touching on the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests"" [10] which may be resolved by a court of law through the application of a law. [11] Courts have no judicial power to review cases involving political questions and as a rule, will desist from taking cognizance of speculative or hypothetical cases, advisory opinions and in cases that has become moot. [12] Subject to certain well-defined exceptions [13] courts will not touch an issue involving the validity of a law unless there has been a governmental act accomplished or performed that has a direct adverse effect on the legal right of the person contesting its validity. [14] In the case of PACU vs. Secretary of Education [15] the petition contesting the validity of a regulation issued by the Secretary of Education requiring private schools to secure a permit to operate was dismissed on the ground that all the petitioners have permits and are actually operating under the same. The petitioners questioned the regulation because of the possibility that the permit might be denied them in the future. This Court held that there was no justiciable controversy because the petitioners suffered no wrong by the implementation of the questioned regulation and therefore, they are not entitled to relief. A mere apprehension that the Secretary of Education will withdraw the permit does not amount to a justiciable controversy. The questioned regulation in the PACU case may be questioned by a private school whose permit to operate has been revoked or one whose application therefor has been denied. [16] This Court cannot rule on the basis of petitioners' speculation that the DENR will approve the application of the heirs of Carantes. There must be an actual governmental act which directly causes or will imminently cause injury to the alleged legal right of the petitioner to possess the land before the jurisdiction of this Court may be invoked. There is no showing that the petitioners were being evicted from the land by the heirs of Carantes under orders from the DENR. The petitioners' allegation that certain documents from the DENR were shown to them by the heirs of Carantes to justify eviction is vague, and it would appear that the petitioners did not verify if indeed the respondent DENR or its officers authorized the attempted eviction. Suffice it to say that by the petitioners own admission that the respondents are still processing and have not approved the application of the heirs of Carantes, the petitioners alleged right to possess the land is not violated nor is in imminent danger of being violated, as the DENR may or may not approve Carantes' application. Until such time, the petitioners are simply speculating that they might be evicted from the premises at some future time. Borrowing from the pronouncements of this Court in the PACU case, ""They (the petitioners) have suffered no wrong under the terms of the law--and, naturally need no relief in the form they now seek to obtain."" [17] If indeed the heirs of Carantes are trying to enter the land and disturbing the petitioners possession thereof even without prior approval by the DENR of the claim of the heirs of Carantes, the case is simply one for forcible entry. WHEREFORE, for lack of justiciable controversy, the decision of the appellate court is hereby set aside. SO ORDERED. Melo, Vitug, Panganiban, and Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ., concur. [1] Subsequently amended by 31-A and 31-B. [2] Special Order no. 31, as amended, series of 1990 states: ""In the interest of the service and consistent with the Constitutional mandate for the recognition and protection of the rights of the indigenous cultural communities to their ancestral lands to ensure their socio-economic and cultural well-being, a Special Task Force that is responsible for acceptance, identification, evaluation, and delineation of ancestral land claims in the Cordillera Administrative Region is hereby created to be composed of the following: xxx xxx xxx xxxx The Special Task Force shall accept, identify, and evaluate all applications/petitions of ancestral land claims in the CAR and if found valid, delineate same by actual ground survey for plotting in a compilation map. The Special Task Force shall coordinate with the Indigenous Community Affairs Division, Special Concerns Office, Regional Secretariat on Townsite Sales Applications and other actively involved concerned government agencies, private and/or non-governmental organizations on the verification of the authenticity of all ancestral land claims by taking into consideration the indigenous customs and practices regarding land use, ownership and management. The compilation map of ancestral land claims prepared by the Survey Section, CENRO Baguio City together with all the pertinent documents thereof shall be turned over to the herein Special Task Force. The Special Task Force shall prepare separate guidelines in the acceptance, identification, evaluation and delineation of ancestral land claims in Baguio City and the rest of the Cordillera Region. It shall classify the applications for ancestral land claims based on the prepared guidelines. Paragraph 6 of DENR Special Order No. 31, Series of 1990 is hereby amended to read as follows: ""The Special Task Force after evaluating and delineating all ancestral land claims shall recommend en banc to the Secretary of the DENR through the Regional Executive Director of CAR and the indigenous community Affairs Division, special concerns Office, for the issuance of Certificates of Ancestral Domain/Land over those areas determined to be ancestral. "" (CA Rollo , pp. 15-19). [3] Special Order no. 25, series of 1993 states: ""In the interest of the service and consistent with the Constitutional mandate for the recognition and protection of the rights of the indigenous cultural communities to their ancestral lands and domains to ensure their economic, social and cultural well-being, a Provincial Special Task Force on Ancestral Domains and a Community Special Task Force on Ancestral Lands are hereby created in every Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) and Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO), respectively, where there is known to exist a concentration of said communities.

D E C I S I O N MAKALINTAL, C.J.: These cases are all petitions for habeas corpus, the petitioners  having been arrested and detained by the military by virtue of the President's  Proclamation No. 1081, dated September 21, 1972. At the outset a word of clarification is in order. This is not the decision of the Court in the  sense that a decision represents a consensus of the required majority of its  members not only on the judgment itself but also on the rationalization of the  issues and the conclusions arrived at. On the final result the vote is practically unanimous; this is a statement  of my individual opinion as well as a summary of the voting on the major  issues. Why no particular Justice has  been designated to write just one opinion for the entire Court will presently  be explained. At one point during our deliberations on these cases it was  suggested that as Chief Justice I should write that opinion. The impracticability of the suggestion  shortly became apparent for a number of reasons, only two of which need be  mentioned. First, the discussions, as  they began to touch on particular issues, revealed a lack of agreement among  the Justices as to whether some of those issues should be taken up although it  was not necessary to do so, they being merely convenient for the purpose of  ventilating vexing questions of public interest, or whether the decision should  be limited to those issues which are really material and decisive in these  cases. Similarly, there was no agreement  as to the manner the issues should be treated and developed. The same destination would be reached, so to  speak, but through different routes and by means of different vehicles of  approach. The writing of separate  opinions by individual Justices was thus unavoidable, and understandably so for  still another reason, namely, that although little overt reference to it was  made at the time, the future verdict of history was very much a factor in the  thinking of the members, no other case of such transcendental significance to  the life of the nation having before confronted this Court. Second — and this to me was the insuperable  obstacle — I was and am of the opinion, which was shared by six other Justices [1] at the time the question was voted upon, that petitioner Jose W. Diokno's motion of December 28, 1973 to withdraw his  petition. (G.R. No. L-35539) should be  granted, and therefore I was in no position to set down the ruling of the Court  on each of the arguments raised by him, except indirectly, insofar as they had  been raised likewise in the other cases. It should be explained at this point that when the Court voted on Diokno's motion to withdraw his petition he was still  under detention without charges, and continued to remain so up to the time the  separate opinions of the individual Justices were put in final form preparatory  to their promulgation on September 12, which was the last day of Justice Zaldivar's tenure in the Court. [2] Before they could be promulgated, however, a major development supervened: petitioner Diokno was released by the President in the morning of September 11, 1974 . In view thereof all the members of this Court except Justice Castro  agreed to dismiss Diokno's petition on the ground  that it had become moot, with those who originally voted to grant the motion  for withdrawal citing said motion as an additional ground for such dismissal. The petitioners in the other cases, except Benigno Aquino , Jr. (G.R. No. L-35546), either have been  permitted to withdraw their petitions or have been released from detention  subject to certain restrictions. [3] In the case of Aquino , formal charges of murder,  subversion and illegal possession of firearms were lodged against him with a  Military Commission on August 11, 1973; and on the following August 23 he  challenged the jurisdiction of said Commission as well as his continued  detention by virtue of those charges in a petition for certiorari and  prohibition filed in this Court (G.R. No. L-37364). The question came up as to whether or not Aquino's petition for habeas corpus should be dismissed on  the ground that the case as to him should more appropriately be resolved in  this new petition. Of the twelve Justices,  however, eight voted against such dismissal and chose to consider the case on  the merits. [4] On Diokno's motion to withdraw his  petition I voted in favor of granting it for two reasons. In the first place such withdrawal would not  emasculate the decisive and fundamental issues of public interest that demanded  to be resolved, for they were also raised in the other cases which still  remained pending. Secondly, since it was  this petitioner's personal liberty that was at stake, I believed he had the  right to renounce the application for habeas corpus he initiated. Even if that right were not absolute I still  would respect his choice to remove the case from this Court's cognizance,  regardless of the fact that I disagreed with many of his reasons for so  doing. I could not escape a sense of  irony in this Court's turning down the plea to withdraw on the ground, so he  alleges among others, that this is no longer the Court to which he originally  applied for relief because its members have taken new oaths of office under the  1973 Constitution and then ruling adversely to him on the merits of his  petition. It is true that some of the statements in the motion are an  affront to the dignity of this Court and therefore should not be allowed to  pass unanswered. Any answer, however,  would not be foreclosed by allowing the withdrawal. For my part, since most of those statement s  are of a subjective character, being matters of personal belief and opinion, I  see no point in refuting them in these cases. Indeed my impression is that they were beamed less to this Court than to  the world outside and designed to make political capital of his personal  situation, as the publicity given to them by some segments of the foreign press  and by local underground propaganda newssheets subsequently confirmed. It was in fact from that perspective that I  deemed it proper to respond in kind, that is, from a non-judicial forum, in an  address I delivered on February 19,   1974 before the LAWASIA, the Philippine Bar Association and the  Philippine Lawyers' Association. Justice Teehankee , it may be stated, is  of the opinion that a simple majority of seven votes out of twelve is legally  sufficient to make the withdrawal of Diokno's petition effective, on the theory that the requirement of a majority of eight  votes applies only to a decision on the merits. In any event, as it turned out, after petitioner Diokno was released by the President on September 11 all  the members of this Court except Justice Castro were agreed that his petition  had become moot and therefore should no longer be considered on the  merits. This notwithstanding, some of  the opinions of the individual members, particularly Justices Castro and Teehankee , should be taken in the time setting in which  they were prepared, that is, before the order for the release of Diokno was issued. The Cases. The events which form the background of these nine petitions are  related, either briefly or in great detail, in the separate opinions filed by  the individual Justices. The petitioners  were arrested and held pursuant to General Order No. 2 of the President  (September 22, 1972), ""for being participants or for having given aid and  comfort in the conspiracy to seize political and state power in the country and  to take over the Government by force . . ."" General Order No. 2 was issued by the President in the exercise  of the powers he assumed by virtue of Proclamation No. 1081 (September 21,  1972) placing the entire country under martial law . The portions of the proclamation immediately  in point read as follows: “* * * * * * * * * ""NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the Philippines ,  by virtue of the powers vested upon me by Article VII, Section 10, Paragraph  (2) of the Constitution, do hereby place the entire Philippines as defined in  Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution under martial law and, in my capacity  as their Commander-in-Chief, do hereby command the Armed Forces of the  Philippines, to maintain law and order throughout the Philippines, prevent or  suppress all forms of lawless violence as well as any act of insurrection or  rebellion and to enforce obedience to all the laws and decrees, orders and  regulations promulgated by me personally or upon my direction. ""In addition, I do hereby order that all persons presently  detained, as well as all others who may hereafter be similarly detained for the  crimes of insurrection or rebellion, and all other crimes and offenses committed in furtherance or on the occasion thereof, or incident thereto, or in  connection therewith, for crimes against national security and the law of  nations, crimes against public order, crimes involving usurpation of authority,  rank, title and improper use of names, uniforms and insignia, crimes committed  by public officers, and for such other crimes as will be enumerated in orders  that I shall subsequently promulgate, as well as crimes as a consequence of any  violation of any decree, order or regulation promulgated by me personally or  promulgated upon my direction shall be kept under detention until otherwise  ordered released by me or by my duly designated representative."" The provision of the 1935 Constitution referred to in the  proclamation reads: ""the President  shall be commander-in-chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to  prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or  rebellion. In case of invasion,  insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety  requires it, he may suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or  place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law."" 1. The first major issue raised by the parties is whether this  Court may inquire into the validity of Proclamation No. 1081. Stated more  concretely, is the existence of conditions claimed to justify the exercise of  the power to declare martial law subject to judicial inquiry? Is the question political or justiciable in character? Justices Makasiar , Antonio, Esguerra , Fernandez, and Aquino hold that the question is political and therefore its determination is beyond  the jurisdiction of this Court. The  reasons are given at length in the separate opinions they have respectively  signed. Justice Fernandez adds that as a  member of the Convention that drafted the 1973 Constitution he believes that  ""the Convention put an imprimatur on the proposition that the  validity of a martial law proclamation and its continuation is political and  non- justiciable in character."" Justice Barredo , on the other hand,  believes that political questions are not per se beyond the Court's  jurisdiction, the judicial power vested in it by the Constitution being plenary  and all-embracing, but that as a matter of policy implicit in the Constitution  itself the Court should abstain from interfering with the Executive's  Proclamation, dealing as it does with national security, for which the  responsibility is vested by the charter in him alone. But the Court should act, Justice Barredo opines, when its abstention from acting would  result in manifest and palpable transgression of the Constitution proven by  facts of judicial notice, no reception of evidence being contemplated for purposes  of such judicial action. It may be noted that the postulate of non- justiciability as discussed in those opinions involves disparate methods of approach. Justice Esguerra maintains that the findings of the President on the existence of the grounds for  the declaration of martial law are final and conclusive upon the Court. He disagrees vehemently with the ruling in Lansang vs. Garcia, 42 SCRA 448, December 11, 1971 , and advocates a  return to Barcelon vs. Baker, 5 Phil. 87  (1905), and Montenegro vs. Castañeda , 91 Phil. 882 (1952). Justice Barredo , for his part, holds that Lansang need not be overturned, indeed does not control in these cases. He draws a distinction between the power of  the President to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, which was  the issue in Lansang , and his power to proclaim  martial law, calling attention to the fact that while the Bill of Rights  prohibits suspension of the privilege except in the instances specified  therein, it places no such prohibition or qualification with respect to the  declaration of martial law. Justice Antonio, with whom Justices Makasiar ,  Fernandez and Aquino concur, finds that there is no  dispute as to the existence of a state of rebellion in the country, and on that  premise emphasizes the factor of necessity for the exercise by the President of  his power under the Constitution to declare martial law, holding that the  decision as to whether or not there is such necesssity is wholly confided to him and therefore is not subject to judicial inquiry,  his responsibility being directly to the people. Arrayed on the side of justiciability are Justices Castro, Fernando, Teehankee and Muñoz Palma. They  hold that the constitutional sufficiency of the proclamation may be inquired  into by the Court, and would thus apply the principle laid down in Lansang although that case refers to the power of the  President to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. The recognition of justiciability accorded to the question in Lansang , it should be  emphasized, is there expressly distinguished from the power of judicial review  in ordinary civil or criminal cases, and is limited to ascertaining  ""merely whether he (the President) has gone beyond the constitutional  limits of his jurisdiction, not to exercise the power vested in him or to  determine the wisdom of his act."" The test is not whether the President's  decision is correct but whether, in suspending the writ, he did or did not act arbitrarily . Applying this test, the finding by the  Justices just mentioned is that there was no arbitrariness in the President's  proclamation of martial law pursuant to the 1935 Constitution; and I concur  with them in that finding. The factual  bases for the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus,  particularly in regard to the existence of a state of rebellion in the country,  had not disappeared, indeed had been exacerbated, as events shortly before said  proclamation clearly demonstrated. On  this point the Court is practically unanimous; Justice Teehankee merely refrains from discussing it. Insofar as my own opinion is concerned the cleavage in the Court  on the issue of justiciability is of not much more  than academic interest for purposes of arriving at a judgment. I am not unduly exercised by American  decisions on the subject written in another age and political clime, or by  theories, of foreign authors in political science. The present state of martial law in the Philippines is peculiarly Filipino and fits into no traditional patterns or judicial  precedents. In the first place I am convinced (as are the other Justices),  without need of receiving evidence as in an ordinary adversary court  proceeding, that a state of rebellion existed in the country when Proclamation  No. 1081 was issued. It was a matter of  contemporary history within the cognizance not only of the courts but of all  observant people residing here at the time. Many of the facts and events recited in detail in the different "" Whereases "" of the proclamation are of common  knowledge. The state of rebellion  continues up to the present. The  argument that while armed hostilities go on in several provinces in Mindanao there are none in other regions except in isolated pockets in Luzon ,  and that therefore there is no need to maintain martial law all over the  country, ignores the sophisticated nature and ramifications of rebellion in a  modern setting. It does not consist  simply of armed clashes between organized and identifiable groups on fields of  their own choosing. It includes  subversion of the most subtle kind, necessarily clandestine and operating  precisely where there is no actual fighting. Underground propaganda, through printed newssheets or rumors  disseminated in whispers; recruitment of armed and ideological adherents,  raising of funds, procurement of arms and materiel , fifth-column  activities including sabotage and intelligence — all these are part of the  rebellion which by their nature are usually conducted far from the battle  fronts. They cannot be counteracted  effectively unless recognized and dealt with in that context . Secondly, my view, which coincides with that of other members of  the Court as stated in their opinions, is that the question of validity of  Proclamation No. 1081 has been foreclosed by the transitory provision of the  1973 Constitution [Art. XVII, Sec. 3(2)] that ""all proclamations, orders,  decrees, instructions, and acts promulgated, issued, or done by the incumbent  President shall be part of the law of the land and shall remain valid, legal,  binding and effective even after . . . the ratification of this Constitution  ..."" To be sure, there is an attempt in these cases to resuscitate the  issue of the effectivity of the new  Constitution. All that, however, is  behind us now. The question has been  laid to rest by our decision in Javellana vs .  Executive Secretary (L-36142, 50 SCRA 30, March 31, 1973), and of course by the  existing political realities both in the conduct of national affairs and in our  relations with other countries. On the effect of the transitory provision Justice Muñoz Palma withholds her assent to any sweeping statement  that the same in effect validated, in the constitutional sense, all ""such  proclamations, decrees, instructions, and acts promulgated, issued, or done by the  incumbent President."" All that she concedes is that the transitory  provision merely gives them ""the imprimatur of a law but not of a  constitutional mandate,"" and as such therefore ""are subject to  judicial review when proper under the Constitution."" Finally, the political-or- justiciable question controversy — indeed, any inquiry by this Court in the present cases  into the constitutional sufficiency of the factual bases for the proclamation  of martial law — has become moot and purposeless as a consequence of the  general referendum of July 27-28, 1973 . The question propounded to the voters  was: ""Under the (1973)  Constitution, the President, if he so desires, can continue in office beyond  1973. Do you want President Marcos to  continue beyond 1973 and finish the reforms he initiated under Martial  Law?"" The overwhelming majority of those who cast their ballots, including  citizens between 15 and 18 years, voted affirmatively on the proposal. The question was thereby 'removed from the  area of presidential power under the Constitution and transferred to the seat  of sovereignty itself. Whatever may be  the nature of the exercise of that power by the President in the beginning —  whether or not purely political and therefore non- justiciable — this Court is precluded from applying its judicial yardstick to the act of  the sovereign. 2. With respect to the petitioners who have been released from  detention but have not withdrawn their petitions because they are still subject  to certain restrictions, [5] the ruling of the Court is that the petitions should be dismissed. The power to  detain persons even without charges for acts related to the situation which  justifies the proclamation of martial law, such as the existence of a state of  rebellion, necessarily implies the power (subject, in the opinion of the  Justices who consider Lansang applicable to the same  test of arbitrariness laid down therein), to impose upon the released detainees conditions or restrictions which are germane to and necessary to carry out the  purposes of the proclamation. Justice  Fernando, however, ""is for easing the restrictions on the right to travel  of petitioner Rodrigo"" and others similarly situated and so to this extent  dissents from the ruling of the majority; while Justice Teehankee believes that those restrictions do not constitute deprivation of physical  liberty within the meaning of the constitutional provision on the privilege of  the writ of habeas corpus. It need only be added that, to my mind, implicit in a state of  martial law is the suspension of the said privilege with respect to persons  arrested or detained for acts related to the basic objective of the  proclamation, which is to suppress invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, or to  safeguard public safety against imminent danger thereof. The preservation of society and national  survival take precedence. On this  particular point, that is, that the proclamation of martial law automatically  suspends the privilege of the writ as to the persons referred to, the Court is  practically unanimous. Justice Fernando,  however, says that to him that is still an open question; and Justice Muñoz Palma qualifiedly dissents from the majority in her  separate opinion, but for the reasons she discusses therein votes for the  dismissal of the petitions. IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING AND FOR THE REASONS STATED BY  THE MEMBERS OF THE COURT IN THEIR SEPARATE OPINIONS, JUDGMENT IS HEREBY  RENDERED DISMISSING ALL THE PETITIONS, EXCEPT THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY  WITHDRAWN BY THE RESPECTIVE PETITIONERS WITH THE APPROVAL OF THIS COURT, AS  HEREINABOVE MENTIONED.

SEPARATE OPINION ANTONIO, J. : These applications for writs of habeas corpus present for  review Proclamation No. 1081 of the President of the Philippines ,  placing the country under martial law on September 21, 1972 , and the legality of the arrest and  detention of prisoners under the aforesaid proclamation. The issues posed have confronted every  democratic government in every clime and in every age. They have always recurred in times of crisis  when the nation's safety and continued existence are in peril. Involved is the problem of harmonizing two  basic interests that lie at the foundation of every democratic constitutional  system. The first is contained in Rosseau's formulation, ""the people's first intention  is that the State shall not perish,"" in other words, the right of the  State to its existence. The second are  the civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution, which ""imply the  existence of an organized system maintaining public order without which liberty  itself would be lost in the excesses of unrestrained abuses...."" (Cox vs. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569 [1940]). The petitions for habeas corpus initially raise the  legality of the arrest and detention of petitioners. As the respondents, however, plead, in  defense, the declaration of martial law and the consequent suspension of the  privilege of habeas corpus , the validity of Proclamation No. 1081 is the  ultimate constitutional issue. Hearings were held on September 26 and 29 and October 6, 1972 . [1] Meanwhile, some of the petitioners were allowed to withdraw their  petitions. [2] Most of the petitioners were subsequently released from custody under certain  conditions and some of them insist that their cases have not become moot as  their freedom of movement is restricted. [3] As of this date, only petitioner Benigno Aquino , Jr. (L-35546) remains in military custody. On August 11, 1973 ,  petitioner Benigno Aquino ,  Jr. was charged before the military commission with the crimes of subversion  under the Anti-Subversion Act (Republic Act No. 1700), murder and illegal  possession of firearms. On August 23,  1973, he filed an action for certiorari and prohibition (L-35546) with  this Court, assailing the validity of his trial before the military commission,  because the creation of military tribunals for the trial of offenses committed  by civilians is unconstitutional in the absence of a state of war or status of  belligerency; being martial law measures, they have ceased with the cessation  of the emergency; and he could not expect a fair trial because the President of  the Philippines had prejudged his case. That action is pending consideration and decision. On December 28, 1973, petitioner Diokno moved to withdraw his petition (L-35539), claiming that there was delay in the  disposition of his case, and that as a consequence of the decision of this  Court in Javellana vs. Executive Secretary (L-36142, March 31, 1973) and of the action of the members of this Court in  taking an oath to support the New Constitution, he has reason to believe that  he cannot ""reasonably expect to get justice in this case.""  Respondents oppose this motion on the ground that public interest or questions  of public importance are involved and the reasons given are factually untrue  and contemptuous. On September 11, 1974 , petitioner Diokno was released from military custody. In view of his release, it was the consensus  of the majority of the Court to consider his case as moot. We shall now proceed to discuss the issues posed by the remaining  cases. 1. Is the determination by the President  of the Philippines of the necessity for the exercise of his power to declare martial law  political, hence, final and conclusive upon the courts, or is it justiciable and, therefore, his determination is subject to  review by the courts? 2. Assuming Lansang to be applicable,  can it be said that the President acted arbitrarily in issuing Proclamation No.  1081? 3. Assuming that the issues are justiciable , can the Supreme  Court upon the facts of record and those judicially known to It now declare  that the necessity for martial law has already ceased? 4. Under a regime of martial law, can the Court inquire into the  legal justification for the arrest and detention as well as the other  constraints upon the individual liberties of the petitioners? In the affirmative, does it have any adequate  legal basis to declare that their detention is no longer authorized by the  Constitution? I CONSTITUTION INTENDED STRONG EXECUTIVE The right of a government to maintain its existence is the most  pervasive aspect of sovereignty. To  protect the nation's continued existence, from external as well as internal  threats, the government ""is invested with all those inherent and implied  powers which, at the time of adopting the Constitution, were generally  considered to belong to every government as such, and as being essential to the  exercise of its functions"" (Mr. Justice Bradley, concurring in Legal  Tender Cases [US] 12 Wall. 457, 554, 556, 20 L.ed .  287, 314, 315). To attain this end,  nearly all other considerations are to be subordinated. The constitutional power to act upon this  basic principle has been recognized by all courts in every nation at different  periods and diverse circumstances. These powers which are to be exercised for the nation's  protection and security have been lodged by the Constitution under Article VII,  Section 10(2) thereof, on the President of the Philippines ,  who is clothed with exclusive authority to determine the occasion on which the  powers shall be called forth. The constitutional provision expressly vesting in the President  the power to place ""the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law  in case of invasion, insurrection or rebellion or imminent danger thereof when  the public safety requires it,"" 1 is taken bodily from the Jones Law  with the difference that the President of the United States had the power to  modify or vacate the action taken by the Governor-General. 2 Although the Civil Governor, under  Section 5 of the Philippine Bill of 1902, could, with the approval of the  Philippine Commission, suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus ,  no power to proclaim martial law was specifically granted. This power is not mentioned in the Federal  Constitution of the United States . It simply designates the President as  commander-in-chief: ""The President shall be Commander-in-Chief of the Army and  Navy of the United States and of the militia of the several states when called into actual service of the United States .  . . ."" 3 Its absence in the Federal Constitution  notwithstanding, President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War placed some  parts of the country under martial law. He predicated the exercise of this power on his authority as  Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and on the ground of extreme necessity  for the preservation of the Union . When not expressly provided in the  Constitution, its justification, therefore, would be necessity. Thus some authoritative writers view it as  ""not a part of the Constitution but is rather a power to preserve the  Constitution when constitutional methods prove inadequate to that end. It is the law of necessity."" 4 Since the meaning of the term ""martial law"" is obscure, as is the  power exercisable by the Chief Executive under martial law, resort must be had  to precedents. Thus the powers of the  Chief Executive under the Commander-in-Chief clause of the Federal Constitution  have been drawn not only from general and specific provisions of the  Constitution but from historical precedents of Presidential action in times of  crises. Lincoln invoked his authority  under the Commander-in-Chief clause of the Federal Constitution for the series  of extraordinary measures which he took during the Civil War, such as the  calling of volunteers for military service, the augmentation of the Army and  Navy, the payment of $2 million from the unappropriated funds in the Treasury to persons unauthorized to receive it, the closing of the  Post Office to ""treasonable correspondence,"" the blockade of Southern  ports, the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus , the arrests and  detentions of persons who were represented to him as being engaged in or  contemplating ""treasonable practices"" — all this for the most part  was done without the least statutory authorization from Congress. The actions of Lincoln ""assert for the President,"" according to Corwin, ""an initiative  of indefinite scope and legislative in effect in meeting the domestic aspects  of a war emergency."" 5 The creation of public offices is  conferred by the Federal Constitution to Congress. During World War I, however, President  Wilson, on the basis of his power under the ""Commander-in-Chief""  clause of the Federal Constitution, created ""public offices,"" which  were copied in lavish scale by President Roosevelt in World War II. ""The principal canons of constitutional  interpretation are in wartime set aside,"" according to Corwin, ""so  far as concerns both the scope of national power and the capacity of the  President to gather unto himself all the constitutionally available powers in  order the more effectively to focus them upon the task of the hour."" 6 The presidential power, ""building on accumulated precedents has taken on  at times, under the stimulation of emergency conditions,"" according to two  eminent commentators, the ""dimensions of executive prerogative as  described by John Locke, of a power to wit, to fill needed gaps in the law, or  even to supersede it so far as may be requisite to realize the fundamental law  of nature and government, namely, that as much as may  be all the members of society are to be preserved."" 7 There is no question that the framers of the 1935 Constitution  were aware of these precedents and of the scope of the power that had been  exercised by the Presidents of the United States in times of grave crisis. The framers of  the Constitution ""were not only idealists but also practical-minded  men."" ""While they abjured wars of aggression they well knew that for  the country to survive provisions for its defense had to be made."" 8 II TEXTUALLY DEMONSTRABLE CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENT OF  ISSUE TO THE PRESIDENT Instead of making the President of the Philippines simply the  commander-in-chief of all the armed forces, with authority whenever it becomes  necessary to call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless  violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, the framers of the 1935 Constitution  expressly conferred upon him the exclusive power and authority to suspend the  privileges of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines, or any  part thereof, under martial law. ""The President shall be commander-in-chief of all armed forces  of the Philippines and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to  prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or  rebellion. In case of invasion,  insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety  requires it he may suspend the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law."" 9 The condition which would warrant the  exercise of the power was not confined to actual invasion, insurrection  or rebellion, but also to imminent danger thereof, when the public  safety requires it. It is evident,  therefore, that while American Presidents derived these extraordinary powers by  implication from the State's right to self-preservation, the President of the  Philippines was expressly granted by the Constitution with all the powers  necessary to protect the nation in times of grave peril. The safety and well-being of the nation required that the  President should not be hampered by lack of authority but was to be a  ""strong executive who could maintain the unity of the nation with  sufficient powers and prerogatives to save the country during great crises and  dangers."" 10 As Delegate Jose P. Laurel comprehensively explained "" xxx A strong executive he is  intended to be, because a strong executive we shall need, especially in the  early years of our independent, or semi-independent existence. A weak executive is synonymous with a weak  government. He shall not be a 'monarch'  or a dictator in time of profound and Octavian peace, but he virtually so  becomes in an extraordinary emergency ; and whatever may be his position, he  bulwarks, normally, the fortifications of a strong constitutional government,  but abnormally, in extreme cases, he is suddenly ushered in as a Minerva,  full-grown and in full panoply of war, to occupy the vantage ground as the  ready protector and defender of the life and honor of his nation .""  (Italics supplied.) 11 The concentration of an amplitude of power in the hand of the  Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, who is at the same  time the elected civilian Chief of State, is predicated upon the fact that it  is he who must initially shoulder the burden and deal with the emergency. By the nature of his position he possesses  and wields the extraordinary powers of self-preservation of the democratic,  constitutional state. In times of crisis  there is indeed unification of responsibility and centralization of authority  in the Chief Executive. ""The  concentration of governmental power in a democracy faced by an emergency,""  wrote Rossiter , ""is a corrective to the crisis inefficiencies  inherent in the doctrine of the separation of powers. . . . In normal times the separation of powers  forms a distinct obstruction to arbitrary governmental action. By this same token, in abnormal times it may  form an insurmountable barrier to decisive emergency action in behalf of the  State and its independent existence. There are moments in the life of any government when all the powers must  work together in unanimity of purpose and action, even if this means the  temporary union of executive, legislative and judicial powers in the hands of  one man. The more complete the separation  of powers in a constitutional system, the more difficult and yet the more  necessary will be their fusion in time of crisis."" [ Rossiter ,  Constitutional Dictatorship, 288-289.] It was intended, however, that the exercise of these  extraordinary powers is for the preservation of the State, its democratic  institutions, and the permanent freedom of its citizens. III RESPONSIBILITY IMPLIES BROAD AUTHORITY AND  DISCRETION The conditions of war, of insurrection or rebellion, or of any  other national emergency are as varied as the means required for meeting them  and it is, therefore, within the contemplation of the Constitution that the  Chief Executive, to preserve the safety of the nation on those times of  national peril, should have the broadest authority compatible with the  emergency in selecting the means and adopting the measures which in his honest  judgment are necessary for the preservation of the nation's safety. ""The circumstances that endanger the  safety of nations are infinite,"" wrote Alexander Hamilton, ""and for  this reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power to  which the care of it is committed. . . This is one of those truths which to a correct and unprejudiced mind  carries its own evidence along with it, and may be obscured, but cannot be made  plainer by argument or reasoning. . . . The means ought to be in proportion to the end; the persons from whose  agency the attainment of any end is expected ought to possess the means by  which it is to be attained."" 1 Mr. Madison expressed the same idea  in the following terms: ""It is vain  to impose constitutional barriers to the impulse of self-preservation. It is worse than in vain, because it plants  in the Constitution itself necessary usurpations of power."" 2 ""Unquestionably,"" wrote Chief Justice Taney in Luther  v. Borden (7 How. 44, [1849], 12 L.ed . 600),  ""a State may use its military power to put down an armed insurrection, too  strong to be controlled by the civil authority. The power is essential to the existence of every government, essential  to the preservation of order and free institutions, and is as necessary to the  States of this Union as to any other government. The State itself must determine what degree  of force the crisis demands. And if the  Government of Rhode Island deemed the armed opposition so formidable, and so  ramified throughout the State, as to require the use of its military force and  the declaration of martial law, we see no ground upon which this Court can  question its authority."" In the Prize cases (17 L.ed .  476, [1863]), the Court ascribed to the President of the United States, by  virtue of his powers as Chief Executive and as Commander-in-Chief, the power  which in Luther v. Borden is attributed to the government as a whole, to  treat of insurrection as a state of war, and the scene of the insurrection as a  seat or theater of war. As Justice Grier  in the Prize cases significantly stated: ""Whether the President in fulfilling his duties as Commander?in-Chief,  in suppressing an insurrection, has met with such hostile resistance, and a  civil war of such alarming proportions as will compel him to accord to them the  character of belligerents, is a question to be decided by him, and this  court must be governed by the decisions and acts of the Political Department of the government, to which this power was entrusted. 'He must determine what degree of force the  crisis demands.'"" (Italics supplied.) In Hirabayashi v. United  States , where the Court upheld the curfew regulations affecting persons of  Japanese ancestry as valid military measures to prevent espionage and sabotage,  there was again reaffirmance of the view that the  Constitution has granted to the President and to Congress in the exercise of  the war powers a ""wide scope for the exercise of judgment and discretion  in determining the nature and extent of the threatened danger and in the  selection of the means for resisting it."" ""Since the Constitution commits to the Executive and to  Congress the exercise of the war power in all the vicissitudes and conditions  of warfare, it has necessarily given them wide scope for the exercise of  judgment and discretion in determining the nature and extent of the threatened  injury or danger and in the selection of the means for resisting it. Ex parte Quirin , supra (317 US 28, 29, ante 12, 13, 63 S Ct 2); cf. Prize Cases, supra (2 Black [ US ]  670, 17 L ed. 477); Martin v. Mott (12 Wheat [ US ]  19, 29, 6 L ed 537, 540). Where as they did here, the conditions call  for the exercise of judgment and discretion and for the choice of means by  those branches of the Government on which the Constitution has placed the  responsibility of war-making, it is not for any court to sit in review of the  wisdom of their action or substitute its judgment for theirs. ""The actions taken must be appraised in the light of the  conditions with which the President and Congress were confronted in the early  months of 1942, many of which, since disclosed, were then peculiarly within the  knowledge of the military authorities."" 3 ""The measures to be taken in carrying on war and to suppress  insurrection,"" according to Justice Swayne , in Stewart  v. Kahn , 4 ""are not defined. The decision of  all questions rests wholly in the discretion of those to whom the substantial  powers involved are confided by the Constitution. In the latter case, the power is not limited  to victories in the field and the dispersion of the insurgent forces. It carries with it inherently the power to  guard against the immediate renewal of the conflict, and to remedy the evils  which have arisen from its rise and progress."" The thrust of those authorities is that the President as  commander-in-chief and chief executive on whom is  committed the responsibility is empowered, indeed obliged, to preserve the  state against domestic violence and alien attack. In the discharge of that duty, he necessarily  is accorded a very broad authority and discretion in ascertaining the nature  and extent of the danger that confronts the nation and in selecting the means  or measures necessary for the preservation of the safety of the Republic. The terms ""insurrection"" and ""rebellion"" are  in a large measure incapable of precise or exact legal definitions and are more  or less elastic in their meanings. As to  when an act or instance of revolting against civil or political authority may  be classified as an ""insurrection"" or as a ""rebellion"" is a  question better addressed to the President, who under the Constitution is the  authority vested with the power of ascertaining the existence of such  exigencies and charged with the responsibility of suppressing them. To suppress such danger to the state, he is  necessarily vested with a broad authority and discretion, to be exercised under  the exigencies of each particular occasion as the same may present itself to  his judgment and determination. His  actions in the face of such emergency must be viewed in the context of the  situation as it then confronted him. It  is not for any court to sit in review of the wisdom of his action as  commander-in-chief or to substitute its judgment for his. IV NEED FOR UNQUESTIONING ADHERENCE TO POLITICAL  DECISION It is, however, insisted that even with the broad discretion  granted to the President by the Constitution in ascertaining whether or not  conditions exist for the declaration of martial law, his findings in support of  such declaration should nevertheless be subject to judicial review. It is important to bear in mind that We are here dealing with a plenary and exclusive power conferred upon the Chief  Executive by the Constitution. The power  itself is to be exercised upon sudden emergencies, and under circumstances  which may be vital to the existence of the government. A prompt and unhesitating obedience to orders  issued in connection therewith is indispensable as every delay and obstacle to  its immediate implementation may jeopardize the public interests. By reason of his unique position as Chief Executive and as  Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, it is he, more than  any other high official of the government, who has the authority and the means  of obtaining through the various facilities in the civil and military agencies  of the government under his command, information promptly and effectively, from  every quarter and corner of the state about the actual peace and order  condition of the country. In connection  with his duty and responsibility, he is necessarily accorded the wise and  objective counsel of trained and experienced specialists on the subject. Even if the Court could obtain all available  information, it would lack the facility of determining whether or not the insurrection  or rebellion or the imminence thereof poses a danger to the public safety. Nor could the courts recreate a complete  picture of the emergency in the face of which the President acted, in order to  adequately judge his military action. Absent any judicially discoverable and manageable standards for  resolving judicially those questions, such a task for a court to undertake may  well-nigh be impossible. On the other  hand, the President, who is responsible for the peace and security of the  nation, is necessarily compelled by the Constitution to make those  determinations and decisions. The matter  is committed to him for determination by criteria of political and military  expediency. There exists, therefore, no  standard ascertainable by settled judicial experience by reference to which his  decision can be reviewed by the courts. 1 Indeed, those are military  decisions and in their very nature, ""military decisions are not  susceptible of intelligent and judicial appraisal. They do not pretend to rest on evidence, but  are made on information that often would not be admissible and on assumptions  that could not be proved. Information in  support of an order could not be disclosed to courts without danger that it  would reach the enemy. Neither can  courts act on communications made in confidence. Hence, courts can never have any real  alternative to accepting the mere declaration of the authority that issued the  order that it was reasonably necessary from a military viewpoint."" 2 He  is necessarily constituted the judge of the existence of the exigency in the  first instance and is bound to act according to his belief of the facts. Both reason and authority, therefore, dictate that the  determination of the necessity for the exercise of the power to declare  martial law is within the exclusive domain of the President and his  determination is final and conclusive upon the courts and upon all  persons. (cf. Fairman , Martial Rule and the Suppression of  Insurrection, p. 771.) 3 This construction necessarily  results from the nature of the power itself, and from the manifest object  contemplated by the Constitution. (a) Barcelon vs. Baker. The existing doctrine at the time of the framing and adoption of  the 1935 Constitution was that of Barcelon vs .  Baker (5 Phil., 87). It enunciated  the principle that when the Governor-General with the approval of the  Philippine Commission, under Section 5 of the Act of Congress of July, 1, 1902,  declares that a state of rebellion, insurrection or invasion exists, and by  reason thereof the public safety requires the suspension of the privileges of  habeas corpus, this declaration is held conclusive upon the judicial department  of the government . And when the  Chief Executive has decided that conditions exist justifying the suspension of  the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, courts will presume that such  conditions continue to exist until the same authority has decided that  such conditions no longer exist . These doctrines are rooted on pragmatic considerations and sound reasons  of public policy. The ""doctrine  that whenever the Constitution or a statute gives a discretionary power to any  person, such person is to be considered the sole and exclusive judge of the existence  of those facts"" has been recognized by all courts and ""has never been  disputed by any respectable authority."" ( Barcelon vs. Baker, supra .) The political department, according to Chief Justice  Taney in Martin vs. Mott (12 Wheat 29-31), is the sole judge of the  existence of war or insurrection, and when it declares either of these  emergencies to exist, its action is not subject to review or liable to be  controlled by the judicial department of the State. ( Citing Franklin vs. State Board of Examiners , 23 Cal. 172, 178.) The dangers and difficulties which would grow out of the  adoption of a contrary rule are clearly and ably pointed out in the Barcelon case , thus: ""If the investigation and findings of the President, or the  Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine Commission, are not conclusive  and final as against the judicial department of the Government, then every  officer whose duty it is to maintain order and protect the lives and property  of the people may refuse to act, and apply to the judicial department of the  Government for another investigation and conclusion concerning the same  conditions, to the end that they may be protected against civil actions  resulting from illegal acts."" ""Owing to conditions at times, a state of insurrection,  rebellion, or invasion may arise suddenly and may jeopardize the very existence  of the State. Suppose, for example, that  one of the thickly populated Governments situated near this Archipelago,  anxious to extend its power and territory, should suddenly decide to invade  these Islands , and should, without warning, appear in  one of the remote harbors with a powerful fleet and at once begin to land  troops. The governor or military  commander of the particular district or province notifies the Governor-General  by telegraph of this landing of troops and that the people of the  district are in collusion with such invasion. Might not the Governor-General and the Commission accept this telegram  as sufficient evidence and proof of the facts communicated and at once take  steps, even to the extent of suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus , as might appear to them to be necessary to repel such  invasion? It seems that all men  interested in the maintenance and stability of the Government would answer this  question in the affirmative. ""But suppose some one, who has been Arrested in the district  upon the ground that his detention would assist in restoring order and in  repelling the invasion, applies for the writ of habeas corpus , alleging  that no invasion actually exists; may the judicial department of the Government  call the officers actually engaged in the field before it and away from their  posts of duty for the purpose of explaining and furnishing proof to it  concerning the existence or nonexistence of the facts proclaimed to exist by the  legislative and executive branches of the State? If so, then the courts may effectually tie  the hands of the executive, whose special duty it is to enforce the laws and  maintain order, until the invaders have actually accomplished their  purpose. The interpretation contended  for here by the applicants, so pregnant with detrimental results, could not  have been intended by the Congress of the United    States when it enacted the law. ""It is the duty of the legislative branch of the Government to  make such laws and regulations as will effectually conserve peace and good  order and protect the lives and property of the citizens of the State. It is the duty of the Governor-General to  take such steps as he deems wise and necessary for the purpose of enforcing such  laws. Every delay and hindrance and  obstacle which prevents a strict enforcement of laws under the conditions  mentioned necessarily tends to jeopardize public interest and the safety of the  whole people. If the judicial  department of the Government, or any officer in the Government, has a right to  contest the orders of the President or of the Governor-General under the  conditions above supposed, before complying with such orders, then the hands of  the President or the Governor-General may be tied until the very object of the  rebels or insurrectos or invaders has been  accomplished . But it is urged that  the President, or the Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine  Commission, might be mistaken as to the actual conditions; that the legislative  department — the Philippine Commission — might, by resolution, declare after  investigation, that a state of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion exists, and  that the public safety requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus , when, as a matter of fact, no such conditions actually existed;  that the President, or Governor-General acting upon the authority of the  Philippine Commission, might by proclamation suspend the privilege of the writ  of habeas corpus , without there actually existing the conditions mentioned in the act of Congress. In other words, the applicants allege in  their argument in support of their application for the writ of habeas  corpus, that the legislative and executive branches of the Government might  reach a wrong conclusion from their investigations of the actual conditions, or  might, through a desire to oppress and harass the people, declare that a state  of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion existed and that public safety required  the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , when  actually and in fact no such conditions did exist. We can not assume that the legislative and  executive branches will act or take any action based upon such motives. ""Moreover, it cannot be assumed that the legislative and  executive branches of the Government, with all the machinery which those  branches have at their command for examining into the conditions in any part of  the Archipelago, will fail to obtain all existing information concerning actual  conditions. It is the duty of the  executive branch of the Government to constantly inform the legislative branch  of the Government of the condition of the Union as to  the prevalence of peace or disorder. The  executive branch of the Government, through its numerous branches of the civil  and military, ramifies every portion of the Archipelago, and is enabled thereby  to obtain information from every quarter and corner of the State. Can the judicial department of the  Government, with its very limited machinery for the purpose of investigating  general conditions, be any more sure of ascertaining  the true conditions throughout the Archipelago, or in any particular districts  than the other branches of the Government? We think not."" (5 Phil., pp. 93-96.) (b) The  Constitutional Convention of 1934. This was the state of Philippine jurisprudence on the matter,  when the Constitutional Convention met on July 20, 1934 . It  must be recalled that, under the Philippine Bill of 1902, the suspension of the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus by the Governor-General was  subject to the approval of the Philippine Commission (Section 5, Act of  Congress of July 1, 1902), while, under Section 21 of the Jones Law of 1916,  the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus as well as  the proclamation of martial law by the Governor-General could be modified or  vacated by the President of the United States. When the first Draft was submitted conferring the power to suspend the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus exclusively upon the President,  Delegate Araneta proposed an amendment to the effect  that the National Assembly should be the organ empowered to suspend the  privileges of the writ of habeas corpus and, when not in session, the  same may be done by the President with the consent of the majority of the  Supreme Court. Under the provisions of  the Draft, Delegate Araneta argued, ""the Chief  Executive would be the only authority to determine the existence of the reasons  for the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus : and, according to Philippine jurisprudence,  the Supreme Court would refuse to review the findings of the Executive on the  matter. Consequently, he added, arrests  would be effected by military men who were generally  arbitrary. They would be arresting  persons connected with the rebellion, insurrection, invasion; some of them  might also be arresting other persons without any cause whatsoever. The result would be that many persons might  find themselves detained when in fact they had no connection whatsoever with  the disturbances."" 4 Notwithstanding the brilliant  arguments of Delegate Araneta , the Convention voted  down the amendment. Evident was the  clear intent of the framers of the Charter of vesting on the President the  exclusive power of suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus ,  and the conclusive power to determine whether the exigency has arisen requiring  the suspension. There was no opposition  in the Convention to the grant on the President of the exclusive power to place  the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law. Realizing the fragmentation of the Philippines into thousands of islands and of the war clouds that were then hovering over Europe and Asia , the aforesaid framers of the Charter opted for  a strong executive. The provision of Section 10, Paragraph 2, of Article VII of the  1935 Constitution was, therefore, adopted in the light of the Court's  interpretation in Barcelon vs. Baker . (c) Montenegro vs. Castañeda . On August 30, 1952, or 17 years after the ratification of the  1935 Constitution, this Court in Montenegro vs. Castañeda ,  (91 Phil., 882, 887), construing the power of the President of the Philippines  under Article VII, Section 10, Paragraph 2, of the Constitution, re-affirmed  the doctrine in Barcelon vs. Baker, thus: ""We agree with the Solicitor  General that in the light of the view of the United States Supreme Court  through Marshall, Taney and Story quoted with approval in Barcelon vs. Baker (5 Phil., 87, 99-100), the authority to decide whether the  exigency has arisen requiring suspension belongs to the President and 'his  decision is final and conclusive' upon the courts and upon all other  persons."" On Montenegro's contention that there is no state of invasion,  insurrection, rebellion or imminent danger thereof, as the ""intermittent sorties  and lightning attacks by organized bands in different places are occasional,  localized and transitory,"" this Court explained that to the unpracticed  eye the repeated encounters between dissident elements and military troops may  seem sporadic, isolated, or casual. But  the officers charged with the Nation's security, analyzed the extent and  pattern of such violent clashes and arrived at the conclusion that they were  warp and woof of a general scheme to overthrow the government "" vi et armis , by force of arms."" This Court then  reiterated one of the reasons why the finding of the Chief Executive that there  is ""actual danger of rebellion"" was accorded conclusiveness,  thus: ""Indeed, as Justice Johnson  said in that decision, whereas the Executive branch of the Government is  enabled thru its civil and military branches to obtain information about peace  and order from every quarter and corner of the nation, the judicial department,  with its very limited machinery can not be in better position to ascertain or evaluate  the conditions prevailing in the Archipelago."" ( Montenegro vs. Castañeda and Balao ,  91 Phil., 882, 886-887.) It is true that the Supreme Court of the United    States in Sterling vs. Constantin , 5 asserted its authority to review the action taken by the State Governor of  Texas under his proclamation of martial law. However, the Court chose not to overturn the principle expressed in Moyer  vs. Peabody that the question of necessity is ""one strictly reserved  for executive discretion."" It held that, while the declaration of necessity is conclusive, the measures employed are reviewable : ""It does not follow from the fact that the executive has this  range of discretion, deemed to be a necessary incident of his power to suppress  disorder that every sort of action the Governor may take, no matter how  unjustified by the exigency or subversive of private right and the jurisdiction  of the courts, otherwise available, is conclusively supported by mere executive  fiat. The contrary is  well-established. What are the limits of  military discretion, and whether or not they have been overstepped in a  particular case, are judicial questions. . ."" This ruling in Sterling should be viewed within the context of its factual environment. At issue was the validity of the attempt of  the Governor to enforce by executive or military order the restriction on the  production of oil wells which the District Judge had restrained pending proper  judicial inquiry. The state Governor  predicated his power under martial law, although it was conceded that ""at  no time has there been any actual uprising in the territory; at no time has any  military force been exerted to put riots and mobs down."" The Court  disapproved the order of the Governor as it had no relation to the suppression  of disorder but on the contrary it undermined the restraining order of the  District Judge. The Court declared that  the Governor could not bypass the processes of constitutional government by  simply declaring martial law when no bona fide emergency existed. While this case shows that the judiciary can  interfere when no circumstances existed which could reasonably be  interpreted as constituting an emergency, it did not necessarily resolve the  question whether the Court could interfere in the face of an actual  emergency . (d) Lansang vs. Garcia. Our attention is, however, invited to Lansang vs . Garcia (G.R. No. L-33964 etc., December 11, 1971, 42 SCRA 448) where  this Court declared, in connection with the suspension of the privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus by the President of the Philippines on August 21,  1971, that it has the authority to inquire into the existence of the factual  basis of the proclamation in order to determine the constitutional sufficiency  thereof. But this assertion of authority  is qualified by the Court's unequivocal statement that ""the function of  the Court is merely to check — not to supplant — the Executive, or to  ascertain merely whether he has gone beyond the constitutional limits of  his jurisdiction, not to exercise the power vested in him or to  determine the wisdom of his act."" And ""that judicial inquiry into the  basis of the questioned proclamation can go no further than to satisfy the  Court not that the President's decision is correct and that public safety was  endangered by the rebellion and justified the suspension of the writ, but that  in suspending the writ, the President did not act arbitrarily ."" In the ascertainment of the factual basis of the suspension,  however, the Court had to rely implicitly on the findings of the Chief  Executive. It did not conduct any  independent factual inquiry for, as this Court explained in Barcelon and Montenegro, "". . . whereas the Executive branch of the Government is  enabled thru its civil and military branches to obtain information about peace  and order from every quarter and corner of the nation, the judicial department,  with its very limited machinery cannot be in a better position to ascertain or  evaluate the conditions prevailing in the Archipelago."" Indeed, such  reliance on the Executive's findings would be the more compelling when the  danger posed to the public safety is one arising from Communist rebellion and  subversion. We can take judicial notice of the fact that the Communists have  refined their techniques of revolution, but the ultimate object is the same —  ""to undermine through civil disturbances and political crises the will of  the ruling class to govern, and, at a critical point, to take over State power  through well-planned and ably directed insurrection."" 6 Instead of insurrection, there was to be the protracted war. The plan was to retreat and attack only at an  opportune time. ""The major objective is the annihilation of the enemy's  fighting strength and in the holding or taking of cities and places. The holding or taking of cities and places is  the result of the annihilation of the enemy's fighting strength."" 7 The Vietnam War contributed its own brand of terrorism conceived by Ho Chi Minh and Vo Nguyen Giap — the  silent and simple, assassination of village officials for the destruction of  the government's administrative network. Modern rebellion now is a war of sabotage and harassment, of an  aggression more often concealed than open, of guerrillas striking at night, of  assassins and terrorists, and of professional revolutionaries resorting to all  sorts of stratagems, crafts, methods and subterfuge, to undermine and subvert  the security of the State to facilitate its violent overthrow. 8 In the ultimate analysis even assuming that the matter is justiciable and We apply the  standards set in Lansang , by ascertaining  whether or not the President acted arbitrarily in issuing Proclamation No.  1081, the result would be the same. For the existence of an actual rebellion and insurrection in this  country by a sizable group of men who have publicly risen in arms to overthrow  the government was confirmed by this Court in Lansang . "". . . our jurisprudence attests  abundantly to the Communist activities in the Philippines ,  especially in Manila , from the late  twenties to the early thirties, then aimed principally at incitement to  sedition or rebellion, as the immediate objective. Upon the establishment of the Commonwealth of  the Philippines, the movement seemed to have waned notably; but, the outbreak  of World War II in the Pacific and the miseries, the devastation and havoc and  the proliferation of unlicensed firearms concomitant with the military  occupation of the Philippines and its subsequent liberation, brought about, in  the late forties, a resurgence of the Communist threat, with such vigor as to  be able to organize and operate in Central Luzon an army — called HUKBALAHAP,  during the occupation, and renamed Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan (HMB) after liberation — which clashed several times with the armed  forces of the Republic. This prompted  then President Quirino to issue Proclamation No. 210,  dated October 22, 1950 ,  suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , the validity of  which was upheld in Montenegro vs . Castañeda . Days before the promulgation of said Proclamation, or on October 18, 1950 , members of the  Communist Politburo in the Philippines were apprehended in Manila . Subsequently accused and convicted of the  crime of rebellion, they served their respective sentences. ""The fifties saw a comparative lull in Communist activities,  insofar as peace and order were concerned. Still, on June 20, 1957, Republic Act No. 1700, otherwise known as the  Anti-Subversion Act, was approved, upon the ground stated in the very preamble  of said statute — that '. . . the Communist Party of the Philippines, although purportedly  a political party is in fact an organized conspiracy to overthrow the  Government of the Republic of the Philippines not only by force and violence  but also by deceit, subversion and other illegal means, for the purpose of establishing  in the Philippines a totalitarian regime subject to alien domination and  control; '. . . the continued existence and activities of the Communist  Party of the Philippines constitutes a clear , present and grave danger to the  security of the Philippines ;  and '. . . in the face of the organized, systematic and persistent  subversion, national in scope but international in direction, posed by the  Communist Party of the Philippines and its activities, there is urgent need for  special legislation to cope with this continuing menace to the freedom and  security of the country . . .' ""In the language of the Report on Central Luzon ,  submitted, on September 4, 1971 ,  by the Senate Ad Hoc Committee of Seven — copy of which Report was filed in  these cases by the petitioners herein — 'The years following 1963 saw the successive emergence in the  country of several mass organizations, notably the Lapiang Manggagawa (now the Socialist Party of the  Philippines) among the workers; the Malayang Samahan ng Mga Magsasaka (MASAKA) among the peasantry; the Kabataang Makabayan (KM) among  the youth/students; and the Movement for the Advancement of Nationalism (MAN)  among the intellectuals/professionals. The PKP has exerted all-out effort to infiltrate, influence and utilize  these organizations in promoting its radical brand of nationalism.' ""Meanwhile, the Communist leaders in the Philippines had been  split into two (2) groups, one of which — composed mainly of young radicals,  constituting the Maoist faction — reorganized the Communist Party of the  Philippines early in 1969 and established a New People's Army. This faction adheres to the Maoist concept of  the 'Protracted People's War' or 'War of National Liberation.' Its ' Programme for a People's Democratic Revolution' states, inter alia : ' The Communist Party of the Philippines is determined to implement its general programme for  a people's democratic revolution. All  Filipino communists are ready to sacrifice their lives for the worthy cause of  achieving the new type of democracy, of building a new Philippines that is genuinely and completely independent, democratic, united, just and  prosperous . . . * * * * * * *  * * 'The central task of any revolutionary movement is to seize  political power. The Communist Party  of the Philippines assumes this task at time that both the international and national  situations are favorable to taking the road of armed revolution. . .' ""In the year 1969, the NPA had — according to the records of  the Department of National Defense — conducted raids, resorted to kidnappings  and taken part in other violent incidents numbering over 230, in which it  inflicted 404 casualties, and, in turn, suffered 243 losses. In 1970, its record of violent incidents was  about the same, but the NPA casualties more than doubled. ""At any rate, two (2) facts are undeniable: (a) all Communists, whether they belong to  the traditional group or to the Maoist faction, believe that force and violence  are indispensable to the attainment of their main and ultimate objective, and  act in accordance with such belief, although they may disagree on the means to  be used at a given time and in a particular place; and (b) there is a New  People's Army, other, of course, than the armed forces of the Republic and  antagonistic thereto. Such New People's  Army is per se proof of the existence of a rebellion, especially  considering that its establishment was announced publicly by the  reorganized CPP. Such announcement is in  the nature of a public challenge to the duly constituted authorities and may be  likened to a declaration of war, sufficient to establish a war status or a  condition of belligerency, even before the actual commencement of hostilities. ""We entertain, therefore, no doubts about the existence of  a sizable group of men who have publicly risen in arms to overthrow the  government and have thus been and still are engaged in rebellion against the  Government of the Philippines. * * * * * * ""The records before Us show that, on or before August 21, 1971,  the Executive had information and reports — subsequently confirmed, in many  respects, by the abovementioned Report of the Senate Ad-Hoc Committee of Seven  — to the effect that the Communist Party of the Philippines does not merely  adhere to Lenin's idea of a swift armed uprising; that it has, also, adopted Ho  Chi Minh's terrorist tactics and resorted to the  assassination of uncooperative local officials; ""Petitioners, similarly, fail to make into account that — as  per said information and reports — the reorganized Communist Party of the  Philippines has, moreover, adopted Mao's concept of protracted people's war,  aimed at the paralyzation of the will to resist of  the government, of the political, economic and intellectual leadership, and of  the people themselves; that conformably to such concepts, the Party has placed  special emphasis upon a most extensive and intensive program of subversion by  the establishment of front organizations in urban centers, the organization of  armed city partisans and the infiltration in student groups labor unions, and  farmer and professional groups; that the CPP has managed to infiltrate or  establish and control nine (9) major labor organizations; that it has exploited  the youth movement and succeeded in making Communist fronts of eleven (11)  major student or youth organizations; that there are, accordingly about thirty  (30) mass organizations actively advancing the CPP interest, . . . .; that in 1970, the Party had recorded two  hundred fifty-eight (258) major demonstrations, of which about thirty-three  (33) ended in violence, resolution in fifteen (15) killed and over five hundred  (500) injured; that most of these actions were organized, coordinated or led by  the aforementioned front organizations; that the violent demonstrations were  generally instigated by a small but well-trained group of armed agitators; that  the number of demonstrations heretofore staged in 1971 has already exceeded  those of 1970; and that twenty-four (24) of these demonstrations were violent,  and resulted in the death of fifteen (15) persons and the injury to many more. ""Subsequent events — as reported — have also proved that  petitioners' counsel have underestimated the threat to public safety posed by the New People's Army. Indeed,  it appears that, since August 21, 1971 , it had in Northern Luzon six (6)  encounters and staged one (1) raid, in consequence of which seven (7) soldiers  lost their lives and two (2) others were wounded, whereas the insurgents  suffered five (5) casualties; that on August 26, 1971, a well-armed group of  NPA, trained by defector Lt. Victor Corpus, attacked the very command post of  TF LAWIN in Isabela , destroying two (2) helicopters  and one (1) plane, and wounding one (1) soldier; that the NPA had in Central  Luzon a total of four (4) encounters, with two (2) killed and three (3) wounded  on the side of the Government, one (1) BSDU killed and three (3) NPA  casualties; that in an encounter at Botolan , Zambales , one (1) KM-SDK leader, an unidentified dissident,  and Commander Panchito , leader of the dissident group  were killed; that on August 26, 1971, there was an encounter in the barrio of  San Pedro, Iriga City, Camarines Sur , between PC and the NPA, in which a PC and two  (2) KM members were killed; that the current disturbances in Cotabato and the Lanao provinces  have been rendered more complex by the involvement of the CPP/NPA, for, in  mid-1971, a KM group, headed by Jovencio Esparagoza , contacted the Higa-onan tribes, in their settlement in Magsaysay , Misamis Oriental, and offered them books, pamphlets and  brochures of Mao Tse Tung ,  as well as conducted teach-ins in the reservation; that Esparagoza was reportedly killed on September 22, 1971, in an operation of the PC in said  reservation; and that there are now two (2) NPA cadres in Mindanao."" It is true that the suspension of the privilege of the writ was  lifted on January 7, 1972, but it can not be denied that soon thereafter,  lawlessness and terrorism had reached such a point that the nation was already  drifting towards anarchy. On September 21, 1972 ,  when the President of the Philippines ,  pursuant to Article VII, section 10, paragraph 2, of the 1935 Constitution,  placed the Philippines under martial law, the nation was in the throes of a crisis. The authority of the constitutional government  was resisted openly by a coalition of forces, of large numbers of persons who  were engaged in an armed conflict for its violent overthrow. 9 The Muslim secessionist movement with the active material and financial  assistance of foreign political and economic interests was engaged in an open  attempt to establish by violence and force a separate and independent political  state. Forceful military action, matched with attractive benevolence and  a socio-economic program, has indeed broken the back of the rebellion in some  areas. There are to be sure significant  gains in the economy, the unprecedented increase in production and in exports,  the billion-dollar international reserve, the new high in revenue collections and  other notable infrastructures of development and progress. Indeed there is a noticeable transformation  in the people's sense of values, in their attitudes and motivations. But we personally take notice of the fact  that even as of this late date, there is still a continuing rebellion that poses  a danger to the public safety. Communist  insurgency and subversion, once it takes root in any nation, is a hardy  plant. A party whose strength is in  selected, dedicated, indoctrinated and rigidly disciplined members, which may even now be secreted in strategic posts in  industry, schools, churches and in government, can not easily be eradicated. 10 The NPA (New People's Army) is pursuing a policy of strategic  retreat but tactical offensive. It  continues to conduct its activities through six Regional Operational Commands ( ROCs ) covering Northern, Central, and Southern Luzon ,  Western and Eastern Visayas ,  and Mindanao . Combat operations were conducted against the Communist insurgents by the  armed forces of the government in Cagayan , Ifugao , Kalinga , Apayao , Camarines Sur , and Sorsogon . Subversive activities continue unabated in  urban areas. Last January, 1974, the  Maoist group known as the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) attacked and  overran the military detachment at Bilaan , Sulu , and the town of Parang . The town of Jolo was attacked by a rebel force  of 500 men last February 6, 1974, and to cover their retreat razed two-thirds  of the town. Only this August, there was  fighting between government troops and Muslim rebels armed with modern and sophisticated  weapons of war in some parts of Cotabato and in the  outskirts of the major southern port city of Davao . It would be an incredible naivete to conclude in the face of such a reality, that the peril to public safety had  already abated. Nor is the fact that the courts are open proof that there is no  ground for martial rule or its continuance. The ""open court"" theory has been derived from the dictum in Ex Parte Milligan (7 Wall 127 [1866]), viz .: ""Martial rule cannot arise from a  threatened invasion; the necessity must be actual and present; the invasion  real such as effectually closes the courts and deposes the civil  administration."" This has been dismissed as unrealistic by authoritative  writers on the subject as it does not present an accurate definition of the  allowable limits of the martial law powers of the President of the United    States . As a matter of fact, the limiting force of the Milligan case was  materially modified a generation later in another decision of the Federal  Supreme Court in Moyer vs. Peabody (212 U.S. 78 [1909]). Speaking for the Court in Moyer vs. Peabody , Justice  Holmes brushed aside as immaterial the fact, which the majority opinion  in the Milligan case thought as absolutely crucial — viz .: martial rule can never exist where the Courts  are open and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their  jurisdiction. The opinion admitted that  the Courts were open but held ""that the governor's declaration that  a state of insurrection existed is conclusive of that fact."" Although It  found that the ""Governor, without sufficient reason, but in good faith ,  in the course of putting the insurrection down, held the plaintiff until he  thought that he could safely release him,"" the Court held that plaintiff  Moyer had no cause of action. Stating  that the Governor was empowered to employ the National Guard to suppress  insurrection, the Court further declared that ""he may kill persons who  resist, and of course he may use the milder measure of seizing the bodies of  those whom he considers to stand in the way of restoring peace. Such arrests are not necessarily for  punishment, but are by way of precaution, to prevent the exercise of hostile power."" ""So long as such arrests are made in good faith and in the  honest belief that they are needed in order to head the insurrection off, the  Governor is the final judge and cannot be subjected to an action after he is  out of office on the ground that he had no reasonable ground for his belief . . . When it comes to a decision by the  head of state upon a matter involving its life, the ordinary rights of the  individuals must yield to what he deems the necessities of the moment . Public danger warrants the substitution of  executive process for judicial process."" ""It is simply not true,"" wrote Clinton Rossiter in 1950, 11 "" that martial law cannot  arise from a threatened invasion or that martial law can never exist where the  Courts are open. These statements do  not present an accurate definition of the allowable limits of the martial  powers of President and Congress in the face of alien threats or internal  disorder. Nor was Davis '  dictum on the specific powers of Congress in this matter any more  accurate. And, however eloquent and  quotable his words on the untouchability of the  Constitution in times of actual crisis, they do not now, and did not then ,  express the realities of American Constitutional Law."" In any event, this ""open court"" theory does not apply  to the Philippine situation. Both the  1935 and the 1973 Constitutions expressly authorize the declaration of martial  law, even where the danger to the public safety arises merely from the  imminence of an invasion or rebellion. The fact that the civil courts are open can not be controlling, since  they might be open and undisturbed in their functions and yet wholly  incompetent to avert the threatened danger and to punish those involved in the  invasion or rebellion with certainty and promptitude. Certainly such a theory when applied to the  situation of a modern war, and of the present day Communist insurgency and  subversion would prove to be unrealistic. 12 Nor may it be argued that the employment of government resources  for the building of a New Society is inconsistent with the efforts of  suppressing the rebellion and creating a legitimate public order. ""Everyone recognized the legal basis for  the martial necessity,"" wrote President Marcos, ""this was the  simplest theory of all. National decline  and demoralization, social and economic deterioration, anarchy and rebellion  were not just statistical reports; they were documented in the mind and body  and ordinary experience of every Filipino. But, as a study of revolutions and ideologists proves, martial rule  could not in the long run, secure the Philippine Republic unless the  social iniquities and old habits which precipitated the military necessity were  stamped out . Hence, the September 21  Movement for martial rule to be of any lasting benefit to the people and the  nation, to justify the national discipline, should incorporate a movement for  great, perhaps even drastic, reforms in all spheres of national life. Save the Republic, yes, but to keep it safe,  we have to start remaking the society."" 13 Indeed, the creation of a New  Society was a realistic response to the compelling need for revolutionary  change. For centuries, most of our people were imprisoned in a  socio-cultural system that placed them in perpetual dependence. ""It made of the many mere pawns in the  game of partisan-power politics, legitimized 'hewers of wood and drawers of  water' for the landed elite, grist for the diploma mills and an alienated mass  sporadically erupting in violent resentment over immemorial wrongs. Rural backwardness was built into the very  social order wherein our masses could not move forward or even desire to get  moving."" 14 The old political frameworks, transplanted from the West had proven indeed to  be inadequate. The aspirations of our  people for social justice had remained unfulfilled. The electoral process was no model of  democracy in action. To a society that  has been torn up by decades of bitter political strife and social anarchy, the  problem was the rescue of the larger social order from factional  interests. Implicit then was the task of  creating a legitimate public order, the creation of political institutions  capable of giving substance to public interests. This implied the building of coherent  institutions, an effective bureaucracy and an administration capable of  enlisting the enthusiasm, support and loyalty of the people. Evidently, the power to suppress rebellions  or insurrections is not ""limited to victories in the field and the  dispersion of the insurgent forces. It  carries with it inherently the power to guard against the immediate renewal of  the conflict and to remedy the evils"" 15 which spawned and gave rise to the  exigency. We find confirmation of this contemporaneous construction of  presidential powers in the new Constitution. It must be noted that while Art. IX, Sec. 12 of the new Constitution  embodies the commander-in-chief clause of the 1935 Constitution (Art. VII, Sec.  10[2]), it expressly declares in Art. XVII, Sec. 3[2] that the proclamations,  orders and decrees, instructions and acts issued or done by the incumbent  President are ""part of the law of the land"" and are to ""remain  valid, legal, binding, and effective"" until ""modified, revoked, or  superseded by subsequent proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions, or other  acts of the incumbent President, or unless expressly and explicitly modified or  repealed by the regular National Assembly."" Undoubtedly, the aforecited proviso refers to the present martial law regime  and the measures taken under it by the President. It must be recalled that the prudent exercise  by the President of the powers under martial law not only stemmed the tide of  violence and subversion but also buttressed the people's faith in public  authority. It is in recognition of the  objective merit of the measures taken under martial law that the  Constitution affirms their validity. This is evident from the deliberations of the 166-Man Special  Committee of the Constitutional Convention, formed to finally draft the  Constitution, at its meeting on October   27, 1972 , on the provisions of Section 4 of the draft now Section  12 of Article IX of the New Constitution, 15a which are quoted hereunder, to  wit: "" DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): The question, Your Honor,  brings to the fore the nature and concept of martial law. As it is understood by recognized authorities  on the subject, martial law rests upon the doctrine of paramount  necessity. The controlling  consideration, Your Honor, is necessity. The crucial consideration is the very existence of the State, the very  existence of the Constitution and the laws upon which depend the rights of the  citizens, and the condition of peace and order so basic to the continued  enjoyment of such rights. Therefore,  from this view of the nature of martial law, the power is to be exercised not  only for the more immediate object of quelling the disturbance or meeting a  public peril which, in the first place, caused the declaration of martial law,  but also to prevent the recurrence of the very causes which necessitated the  declaration of martial law. Thus Your  Honor, I believe that when President Marcos, to cite the domestic experience,  declared that he proclaimed martial law to save the Republic and to form a New  Society, he was stating the full course which martial law must have to take in  order to achieve its rational end. Because in the particular case of the Philippine situation, I agree with  the President that it is not enough that we be able to quell the rebellion and  the lawlessness, but that we should also be able to eliminate the many ills and  evils in society which have, in the first place, bred and abetted the rebellion  and the lawlessness. ""DELEGATE LEVISTE (O.): I agree with you wholeheartedly, Your Honor. That's all, Mr. Chairman. ""DELEGATE ADIL: It  seems, Your Honor that we are revolutionizing the traditional concept of  martial law which is commonly understood as a weapon to combat lawlessness and  rebellion through the use of the military authorities. If my understanding is correct, Your Honor,  martial law is essentially the substitution of military power for civilian  authorities in areas where such civilian authorities are unable to discharge  their functions due to the disturbed peace and order conditions therein. But with your explanation Your Honor, it  seems that the martial law administrator, even if he has in the meantime  succeeded in quelling the immediate threats to the security of the state, could  take measures no longer in the form of military operations but essentially and  principally of the nature of ameliorative social action. "" DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): His Honor is correct when he said that we are  abandoning the narrow, traditional and classic concept of martial law. But we are abandoning the same only to  humanize it. For Your Honor will recall  that the old concept of martial law is that the law of the camp is the law of  the land, which we are not ready to accept; and President Marcos, aware as he  is, that the Filipino people will not countenance any suppressive and unjust  action, rightly seeks not only to immediately quell and break the back of the  rebel elements but to form a New Society, to create a new atmosphere which will  not be a natural habitat of discontent. Stated otherwise, the concept of martial law, as now being practiced, is  not only to restore peace and order in the streets and in the towns but to  remedy the social and political environments in such a way that discontent will  not once more be renewed. ""DELEGATE ORTIZ (R.): I can feel from the discussion, Mr. Chairman,  that we are having difficulty in trying to ascertain the scope and limitations  of martial law. To my mind, Mr.  Chairman, it is constitutionally impossible for us to place in this great  document, in black and white, the limits and the extent of martial law. We are framing a Constitution and not a  statute; and unlike a statute, a Constitution must limit itself to providing basic  concepts and policies without going into details. I have heard from some of the Delegates here  their concern that we might be, by this provision and the interpretations being  given to it, departing from the traditional concept of martial law. Concepts are mere concepts, Mr. Chairman; but  concepts, like principles, must be tested by their application to existing  conditions, whether those concepts are contained in statutes or in a  Constitution. Referring specifically to  the exercise of this power by President Marcos, doubts have been expressed in  some quarters, whether in declaring martial law, he could exercise legislative  and judicial powers. I would want to  emphasize that the circumstances which provoked the President in declaring  martial law may not be quantified. In  fact, it is completely different from a case of invasion where the threat to  national security comes from the outside. The martial law declared by the President was occasioned by the acts of  rebellion, subversion, lawlessness and chaos that are widespread in the  country. Their origin, therefore, is  internal. There was no threat from  without, but only from within. But these  acts of lawlessness, rebellion, and subversion are mere manifestations of more  serious upheavals that beset the deepest core of our social order. If we shall limit and constrict martial law  to its traditional concept, in the sense that the military will be merely  called upon to discharge civilian functions in areas where the civil  functionaries are not in a position to perform their normal duties or, better  still, to quell lawlessness and restore peace and order, then martial law would  be a mere temporary palliative and we shall helpless if bound by the old maxim  that martial law is the public law of military necessity, that necessity calls  it forth, that necessity justifies its existence, and necessity measures the  extent and degrees to which it may be employed. My point here, Your Honor, is that beyond martial necessity lies the  graver problem of solving the maladies which, in the first place, brought about  the conditions which precipitated the exercise of his martial powers. If the President, by the exercise of his  martial authority, will be limited to merely taking a military measure to quell  the rebellion and eliminating lawlessness in the country and leave him with no  means or authority to effect the needed social and economic reforms to create  an enduring condition of peace and order, then we shall have failed in  providing in this Constitution the basic philosophy of martial law which, I am  sure, we are embodying in it for the great purpose of preserving the  State. I say that the preservation of  the State is not limited merely to eliminating the threats that immediately  confront it. More than that, the measure  to preserve the State must go deeper into the root causes of the social  disorder that endanger the general safety. "" DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): I need not add more, Mr.  Chairman, to the very convincing remarks of my good friend and colleague,  Delegate Ortiz. And I take it, Mr.  Chairman, that that is also the position of this Committee. ""PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A): Yes, also of this Committee. ""DELEGATE ADIL: Just  one more question, Mr. Chairman, if the distinguished Delegate from La Union  would oblige. "" DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): All the time, Your Honor. ""DELEGATE ADIL: When  martial law is proclaimed, Your Honor, would it mean that the Constitution  which authorizes such proclamation, is set aside or  that at least some provisions of the Constitution are suspended? "" DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): The Constitution is not set  aside, but the operation of some of its provisions must, of necessity, be  restricted, if not suspended, because their continuance is inconsistent with  the proclamation of martial law. For instance,  some civil liberties will have to be suspended upon the proclamation of martial  law, not because we do not value them, but simply because it is impossible to  implement these civil liberties hand-in-hand with the effective and successful  exercise and implementation of martial powers. There are certain individual rights which must be restricted and  curtailed because their exercise and enjoyment would negate the implementation  of martial authority. The preservation  of the State and its Constitution stands paramount over certain individual  rights and freedom. As it were, the  Constitution provides martial law as its weapon for survival, and when the  occasion arises, when such is at stake, prudence requires that certain  individual rights must have to be sacrificed temporarily. For, indeed, the destruction of the  Constitution would mean the destruction of all the rights that flow from it. ""DELEGATE ADIL: Does  your Honor mean to say that when martial law is declared and I, for instance,  am detained by the military authorities, I cannot avail of the normal judicial  processes to obtain my liberty and question the legality of my detention? "" DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): If I am not mistaken, Your  Honor, you are referring to the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus . ""DELEGATE ADIL: Yes, Your Honor, that is correct. ""DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): In that case, Your Honor, I take it that when martial law is proclaimed,  the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is ipso facto suspended  and, therefore, if you are apprehended and detained by the military  authorities, more so, when your apprehension and detention were for an offense  against the security of the State, then you cannot invoke the privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus and ask the courts to order your temporary  release. The privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus , like some other individual rights, must have to yield to the  greater need of preserving the State. Here, we have to make a choice between two values, and I say that in  times of great peril, when the very safety of the whole nation and this  Constitution is at stake, we have to elect for the greater one. For, as I have said, individual rights assume  meaning and importance only when their exercise could be guaranteed by the  State, and such guaranty cannot definitely be had unless the State is in a  position to assert and enforce its authority. ""DELEGATE ADIL: Since  martial law was declared by President Marcus last September 21, 1972, and  announced on September 23, 1972 ,  the President has been issuing decrees which are in the nature of statutes,  regulating as they do, various and numerous norms of conduct of both the  private and the public sectors. Would  you say, Your honor, that such exercise of legislative  powers by the President is within his martial law authority? "" DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A): Certainly, and that is the  position of this Committee. As martial  law administrator and by virtue of his position as Commander-in-Chief of the  Armed Forces, the President could exercise legislative and, if I may add, some  judicial powers to meet the martial situation. The Chief Executive must not be hamstrung or limited to his traditional  powers as Chief Executive. When martial  law is declared, the declaration gives rise to the birth of powers, not  strictly executive in character, but nonetheless necessary and incident to the  assumption of martial law authority to the end that the State may be safe. ""DELEGATE ADIL: I am  not at all questioning the constitutionality of the President's assumption of  powers which are not strictly executive in  character. Indeed, I can concede that  when martial law is declared, the President can exercise certain judicial and  legislative powers which are essential to or which have to do with the quelling  of rebellion, insurrection, imminent danger thereof, or meeting an  invasion. What appears disturbing to me,  and which I want Your Honor to convince me further, is the exercise and  assumption by the President or by the Prime Minister of powers, either  legislative or judicial in character, which have nothing to do with the  conditions of rebellion, insurrection, invasion or imminent danger  thereof. To be more specific, Your Honor, and to cite to you an example, I have in mind  the decree issued by the President proclaiming a nationwide land reform or  declaring land reform throughout the Philippines . I suppose you will agree with me, Your Honor, that such a decree, or any similar decree for that  matter, has nothing to do with invasion, insurrection, rebellion or imminent  danger thereof. My point, Your Honor, is  that this measure basically has nothing to do with the restoration of peace and  order or the quelling of rebellion or insurrection. How could we validly say that the President's  assumption of such powers is justified by the proclamation of martial law? "" DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): As I have repeatedly  stated, Your Honor, we have now to abandon the traditional concept of martial  law as it is understood in some foreign textbooks. We have to look at martial law not as an  immutable principle. Rather, we must  view it in the light of our contemporary experience and not in isolation  thereof. The quelling of rebellion or  lawlessness or, in other words, the restoration of peace and order may  admittedly be said to be the immediate objective of martial law, but that is to  beg the question. For how could there  really be an enduring peace and order if the very causes which spawned the  conditions which necessitated the exercise of martial powers are not remedied? You cite as an example the decree on land  reform. Your Honor will have to admit  that one of the major causes of social unrest among the peasantry in our  society is the deplorable treatment society has given to our peasants. As early as the 1930's, the peasants have  been agitating for agrarian reforms to the extent that during the time of  President Quirino they almost succeeded in  overthrowing the government by force. Were we to adopt the traditional concept of martial law, we would be  confined to merely putting down one peasant uprising after another, leaving  unsolved the maladies that in the main brought forth those uprisings. If we are really to establish an enduring  condition of peace and order and assure through the ages the stability of our Constitution  and the Republic, I say that martial law, being the ultimate weapon of survival  provided for in the Constitution, must penetrate deeper and seek to alleviate  and cure the ills and the seething furies deep in the bowels of the social  structure. In a very real sense,  therefore, there is a profound relationship between the exercise by the martial  law administrator of legislative and judicial powers and the ultimate objective  of martial law. And I may add that in  the ultimate analysis, the only known limitation to martial law powers is the  convenience of the martial law administrator and the judgment and verdict of  the people and, of course, the verdict of history itself. ""DELEGATE LEVISTE (O): Your Honor, just for purposes of discussion, may I know from  you whether there has been an occasion in this country where any past President  had made use of his martial law power? ""DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): I am glad that you asked that question, Your Honor, because it seems  that we are of the impression that since its incorporation into the 1935  Constitution, the martial law provision has never been availed of by any  President. I recall, Your Honor, that  during the Japanese occupation, President Laurel had occasion to declare  martial law, and I recall that when President Laurel declared martial law, he  also assumed legislative and judicial powers. We must, of course, realize that during the time of President Laurel,  the threats to national security which precipitated the declaration came from  the outside. The threats, therefore,  were not internal in origin and character as those which prompted President  Marcos to issue his historic proclamation. If, in case — as what happened during the time of President Laurel — the  declaration of martial law necessitated the exercise of legislative powers by  the martial law administrator, I say that greater necessity calls forth the  exercise of that power when the threats to national security are posed not by  invaders but by the rebellious and seditious elements, both of the left and  right, from within. I say that because  every rebellion, whether in this country or in other foreign countries, is  usually the product of social unrest and dissatisfaction with the established  order. Rebellions or the acts of  rebellion are usually preceded by long suffering of those who ultimately choose  to rise in arms against the government. A rebellion is not born overnight. It is the result of an accumulation of social sufferings on the part of  the rebels until they can no longer stand those sufferings to the point that,  like a volcano, it must sooner erupt. In  this context, the stamping out of rebellion must not be the main and only  objective of martial law. The martial  law administrator should, nay, must, take steps to remedy the crises that lie  behind the rebellious movement, even if in the process, he should exercise  legislative and judicial powers. For  what benefit would it be after having put down a rebellion through the exercise  of martial power if another rebellion is again in the offing because the root  causes which propelled the movement are ever present? One might succeed in capturing the rebel  leaders and their followers, imprison them for life or, better still, kill them  in the field, but someday new leaders will pick up the torch and the tattered  banners and lead another movement. Great  causes of every human undertaking do not usually die with the men behind those  causes. Unless the root causes are  themselves eliminated, there will be a resurgence of another rebellion and,  logically, the endless and vicious exercise of martial law authority. This reminds me of the wise words of an old  man in our town: That if you are going  to clear your field of weeds and grasses, you should not merely cut them, but  dig them out. ""PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.): With the indulgence of the Gentleman from La Union, the Chair would want  to have a recess for at least ten minutes. "" DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): Thank you, Mr.  Chairman. In fact, I was about to move  for it after the grueling interpellations by some of our colleagues here, but  before we recess, may I move for the approval of Section 4? ""PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.): Are there any objections? There  being none, Section 4 is approved."" Although there are authorities to the contrary, it is generally  held that, in construing constitutional provisions which are ambiguous or of  doubtful meaning, the courts may consider the debates in the constitutional  convention as throwing light on the intent of the framers of the Constitution. 16 It is true that the intent of the convention is not controlling by itself, but  as its proceeding was preliminary to the adoption by the people of the  Constitution the understanding of the convention as to what was meant by the  terms of the constitutional provision which was the subject of the  deliberation, goes a long way toward explaining the understanding of the people  when they ratified it. 17 More than this, the people  realized that these provisions of the new Constitution were discussed in the  light of the tremendous forces of change at work in the nation, since the  advent of martial law. Evident in the  humblest villages to the bustling metropolises at the time were the infrastructures and institutional changes made by the government in a bold experiment to create  a just and compassionate society. It was  with an awareness of all of these revolutionary changes, and the confidence of  the people in the determination and capability of the new dispensation to carry  out its historic project of eliminating the traditional sources of unrest in  the Philippines ,  that they overwhelmingly approved the new Constitution. V POLITICAL QUESTION We have adverted to one fact that our jurisprudence attests  abundantly to the existence of a continuing Communist rebellion and subversion,  and on this point there can hardly be any dispute. The narrow question, therefore, presented for  resolution is whether the determination by the President of the Philippines of the necessity for the exercise of his constitutional power to declare  martial law is subject to judicial review. In resolving the question, We re-affirm the  view that the determination of the necessity for the exercise of the  power to declare martial law is within the exclusive domain of the President,  and his determination is final and conclusive upon the courts and upon all  persons. This conclusion necessarily  results from the fact that the very nature of the executive decision is  political, not judicial. The decision as  to whether or not there is necessity for the exercise of the power is wholly  confided by our Constitution to the Chief Executive . For such decision, he is directly responsible  to the people for whose welfare he is obliged to act. In view of the nature of the responsibility  reposed upon him, it is essential that he be accorded freedom of action  demanded by the exigency. The power is  to be exercised upon sudden emergencies and under circumstances vital to the  existence of the State. The issue is  committed to him for determination by criteria of political and military  expediency. It is not pretended to rest  on evidence but on information which may not be acceptable in court. There are, therefore, no standards  ascertainable by settled judicial experience or process by reference to which  his decision can be judicially reviewed. In other words, his decision is of a kind for which the judiciary has neither the aptitude, facilities nor responsibility to undertake . We are unwilling to give our assent to  expressions of opinion which, although not intended, tends to cripple the  constitutional powers of the government in dealing promptly and effectively  with the danger to the public safety posed by the rebellion and Communist  subversion. Moreover, the Court is without power to shape measures for  dealing with the problems of society, much less with the suppression of  rebellion or Communist subversion. The  nature of judicial power is largely negative, and it is essential that the  opportunity of the Chief Executive for well-directed positive action in dealing  with the problem be preserved, if the Government is to serve the best interests  of the people. Finally, as a consequence  of the general referendum of July 27-28, 1973, where 18,052,016 citizens voted  overwhelmingly for the continuance of President Marcos in office beyond 1973 to  enable him to finish the reforms he had instituted under martial law, the  question of the legality of the proclamation of martial law, and its  continuance, had undoubtedly been removed from judicial intervention. We conclude that the proclamation of martial law by the President  of the Philippines on September 21, 1972 and  its continuance until the present are valid as they are in accordance with the  Constitution. VI COURT PRECLUDED FROM INQUIRING INTO LEGALITY OF ARREST  AND DETENTION OF PETITIONERS Having concluded that the Proclamation of Martial Law on  September 21, 1972 by the President of the Philippines and its continuance are  valid and constitutional, the arrest and detention of petitioners, pursuant to  General Order No. 2 dated September 22, 1972 of the President, as amended by  General Order No. 2-A, dated September 26, 1972, may not now be assailed as  unconstitutional and arbitrary. General  Order No. 2 directed the Secretary of National Defense to arrest ""individuals  named in the attached list, for being active participants in the conspiracy to  seize political and state power in the country and to take over the government  by force ... in order to prevent them from further committing acts that are  inimical or injurious to our people, the government and our national  interest"" and ""to hold said individuals until otherwise ordered  released by the President or his duly authorized representative."" It is  not disputed that petitioners are all included in the list attached to General  Order No. 2. It should be important to note that as a consequence of the  proclamation of martial law, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus has been impliedly suspended. Authoritative writers on the subject view the suspension of the writ of habeas  corpus as an incident, but an important incident of a declaration of martial  law . ""The suspension of the writ of habeas corpus is not, in  itself, a declaration of martial law; it is simply an incident, though a very  important incident, to such declaration. But practically, in England and the United States ,  the essence of martial law is the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus , and a declaration of martial law would be utterly useless unless  accompanied by the suspension of the privilege of such writ. Hence, in the United    States the two, martial law and the  suspension of the writ is regarded as one and the same thing. Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1; Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat . 19; Story, Com. on the  Constitution, sec. 1342; Johnson v. Duncan, 3 Martin, N.S. 530."" (12 L.ed . 582-83) Evidently, according to Judge Smalley,  there could not be any privilege of the writ of habeas corpus under  martial law ( In re Field, 9 Fed. Cas . 1 [1862]). The  evident purpose of the suspension of the writ is to enable the executive, as a  precautionary measure, to detain without interference persons suspected of  harboring designs harmful to public safety. ( Ex Parte Zimmerman ,  32 Fed. 2nd. 442, 446). In any  event, the Proclamation of Martial Law, in effect, suspended the privilege of  the writ with respect to those detained for the crimes of insurrection or  rebellion, etc., thus: ""In addition, I do hereby order that all persons presently  detained, as well as all others who may hereafter be similarly detained for the crimes of insurrection or rebellion , and all other crimes and offenses committed in furtherance or on the occasion thereof, or incident thereto, or in  connection therewith, for crimes against national security and the law of  nations, crimes against public order, crimes involving usurpation of authority,  rank, title and improper use of names, uniforms and insignia, crimes committed  by public officers, and for such other crimes as will be enumerated in orders  that I shall subsequently promulgate, as well as crimes as a consequence of any  violation of any decree, order or regulation promulgated by me personally or  promulgated upon my direction shall be kept under detention until otherwise  ordered released by me or by my duly designated representative .""  (Italics supplied). General Order No. 2 was issued to  implement the aforecited provisions of the  proclamation of Martial Law. By the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus , the judiciary is precluded from interfering with the orders of the  Executive by inquiring into the legality of the detention of persons involved  in the rebellion. The arrest and detention of persons reasonably believed to be  engaged in, or connected with, the insurgency are predicated upon the principle  that in time of public disorder it is the right and duty of all citizens  especially the officer entrusted with the enforcement of the law to employ such  force as may be necessary to preserve the peace and restrain those who may be  committing felonies. Encroachments upon  personal liberty, as well as upon private property on those occasions are  justified by the necessity of preserving order and the greater interests of the  political community. The Chief  Executive, upon whom is reposed the duty to preserve the nation in those times  of national peril, has correspondingly the right to exercise broad authority  and discretion compatible with the emergency in selecting the means and  adopting the measures which, in his honest judgment, are necessary for the  preservation of the nation's safety. In  case of rebellion or insurrection, the Chief Executive may ""use the milder  measure of seizing the bodies of those whom he considers to stand in the way of  restoring peace. Such arrests are not  necessarily for punishment but are by way of precaution, to prevent the  exercise of hostile power."" ( Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U.S. 78, 84-85 [1909] 53 L. ed. 411.) The justification for the preventive detention of individuals is  that in a crisis such as invasion or domestic insurrection ""the danger to  the security of nation and its institutions is so great that the government  must take measures that temporarily deprive citizens of certain rights in order  to ensure the survival of the political structure that protects those and other  rights during ordinary times."" ( Developments  —National Security , Vol. 85, Harvard Law Review, March 1972, No. 5, p.  1286). 1 In Moyer v. Peabody ,  supra , the Supreme Court of the United    States upheld the detention of a labor  leader whose mere presence in the area of a violent labor dispute was deemed  likely to incite further disturbances. ""So long as such arrests are made in good faith,"" said the  erudite Justice Holmes, ""and in the honest belief that they are made in  order to head the insurrection off, the governor is the final judge and can not  be subjected to an action after he is out of office, on the ground that he had  no reasonable ground for his belief."" During World War II, persons of Japanese ancestry were evacuated  from their homes in the West Coast and interned in the interior until the  loyalty of each individual could be established. In Korematsu v. United States (323 U.S. 214 [244]), the Supreme Court of the United    States upheld the exclusion of these persons  on the ground that among them a substantial number were likely to be disloyal  and that, therefore, the presence of the entire group created the risk of  sabotage and espionage. Although the  Court avoided deciding the constitutionality of the detention that followed the  evacuation, its separation of the issue of exclusion from that of detention was  artificial, since the separate orders were part of a single over-all  policy. The reasoning behind its  approval of exclusion of persons of Japanese ancestry would seem to apply with  equal force to the detention despite the greater restrictions of movement that  the latter entailed. In the Middle   East , military authorities of Israel have detained suspected Arab terrorists without trial ( Dershowitz , Terrorism and Preventive Detention: The  Case of Israel , 50 Commentaries, Dec. 1970 at 78). Among the most effective countermeasures adopted by governments  in Southeast Asia to prevent the growth of Communist  power has been the arrest and detention without trial of key united front  leaders at suitable times. 2 The preventive detention of persons reasonably believed to be  involved in the Communist rebellion and subversion has long been recognized by  all democratic governments as a necessary emergency measure for restoring  order. ""Because of the difficulty  in piercing the secrecy of tightly knit subversive organizations in order to  determine which individuals are responsible for the violence,  governments have occasionally responded to emergencies marked by the threat or  reality of sabotage or terrorism by detaining persons on the ground that they  are dangerous and will probably engage in such actions."" 3 In the case at bar, petitioner Aquino (L-35546) has already been charged with the violation of the Anti-Subversion  Act (L-37364) and therefore his detention is reasonably related to the quelling  of the rebellion. Upon the other hand,  the other petitioners have been released but their movements are subject to  certain restrictions. The restrictions  on the freedom of movement of these petitioners, as a condition for their  release, are, however, required by considerations of national security. 4 In  the absence of war or rebellion, the right to travel within the Philippines may be considered constitutionally protected. But even under such circumstances that freedom is not absolute. Areas ravaged by floods, fire and pestilence  can be quarantined, as unlimited travel to those areas may directly and  materially interfere with the safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the area  affected. During a rebellion or  insurrection the authority of the commander to issue and enforce police  regulations in the area of the rebellion or insurrection is well  recognized. Such regulations may involve  the limitation of the right of assembly, the right to keep arms, and  restrictions on freedom of movement of civilians. 5 Undoubtedly, measures conceived in good faith, in the face of the emergency and  directly related to the quelling of the disorder fall within the discretion of  the President, in the exercise of his authority to suppress the rebellion and  restore public order. We find no basis, therefore, for concluding that petitioner Aquino's continued detention and the restrictions imposed  on the movements of the other petitioners who were released, are arbitrary. C O N C L U S I O N We realize the transcendental importance of these cases. Beyond the question of deprivation of liberty  of petitioners is the necessity of laying at rest any doubt on the validity of  the institutional changes made to bring the country out of an era of rebellion,  near political anarchy and economic stagnation and to establish the foundation  of a truly democratic government and a just and compassionate society. Indeed, as a respected delegate of two  Constitutional Coventions observed: ""The introduction of martial law has  been a necessary recourse to restore order and steer the country safely though  a severe economic and social crisis."" 6 The exercise of these extraordinary  powers not only to restore civil order thru military force but also to effect  urgently needed reforms in order to root out the causes of the rebellion and  Communist subversion may indeed be an experiment in  government. But it was necessary if the  national democratic institution was to survive in competition with the more  revolutionary types of government. ""National democratic constitutionalism, ancient though its origin  may be,"" observed Dr. C.F. Strong, 7 ""is still in an experimental  stage and if it is to survive in competition with more revolutionary types of  government, we must be prepared to adapt to ever-changing conditions of modern  existence. The basic purpose of a  political institution is, after all, the same wherever it appears: to secure social peace and progress,  safeguard individual rights, and promote national well-­being."" These adaptations and innovations were resorted to in order to  realize the social values that constitute the professed goals of the democratic  polity. It was an attempt to make the  political institution serve as an effective instrument of economic and social  development. The need of the times was  for a more effective mode of decision-making and policy-formulation to enable  the nation to keep pace with the revolutionary changes that were inexorably  reshaping Philippine Society. A  government, observed the then Delegate Manuel Roxas ,  a Member of the Sub-Committee of Seven of the Sponsorship Committee of the 1934  Constitutional Convention, ""is a practical science, not a theory, and a  government can be successful only if in its structure due consideration is  given to the habits, the customs, the character and, as McKinley said, to the  idiosyncrasies of the people."" 8 WHEREFORE , We hereby conclude that (a) the proclamation of  martial law (Proclamation No. 1081) on September 21, 1972 by the President of  the Philippines and its continuance, are valid, as they have been done in  accordance with the Constitution, and (b) as a consequence of the suspension of  the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , upon the proclamation of  martial law, the Court is therefore precluded from inquiring into the legality  of the arrest and detention of these petitioners or on the restrictions imposed  upon their movements after their release from military custody. Accordingly, We vote to dismiss all the  petitions. Makasiar , Fernandez, and Aquino , JJ., concur. [1] Some of those who argued for the petitioners were Attys. Jovito Salonga , Ramon A.

( Proceedings of the Philippine Constitutional Convention, Laurel ,  Vol. III, p. 216. Session of Nov. 10,  1934.) (Italics supplied.) As Delegate Miguel Cuaderno observed "". . . not only among the  members of the Sub-Committee of Seven, but also with a majority of the  delegates was the feeling quite prevalent that there was need of providing for  a strong executive. And in this the  lessons of contemporary history were a powerful influence. In times when rulers exercising the  prerogatives of a dictator appear to give the last ray of hope to peoples suffering from chaos, one could not but entertain the feeling that the safety  and well-being of our young nation require a President who would be unhampered  by lack of authority, or vexatious procrastination of other governmental units  in case of emergency.""

""(2) Correct  utilization of the united front policy to build the broadest possible  national united front to ensure the fullest mobilization of the basic masses as  well as the unity of all the forces that can be united, in an effort to take  over the leadership of the national revolution and establish the revolution on  an alliance of, first, the workers and peasants and, second, an alliance of the  working peoples with the bourgeoisie and other non-working people. ""(3) Reliance  on the peasantry and the establishment of rural bases , because in agrarian  and ' semifeudal ' societies the peasants are the great  majority of the population; 'subjected to threefold oppression and exploitation  by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism' they will provide most of  the human and material resources for the revolution. In essence, the revolution is a peasant  revolution led by the communist party: 'to rely on the peasants, build rural base areas and use the countryside  to encircle and finally capture the cities — such was the way to victory in the  Chinese revolution.' ""(4) Creation  of a communist party-led army of a new type , for a 'universal truth of  Marxism-Leninism' is that 'without a people's army the people have nothing.' A  new type of communist party-led army in which 'politics is the commander' must  be formed, one which focuses on instilling in the minds of the population a  'proletarian revolutionary consciousness and courrage '  and which actively seeks the 'support and backing of the masses.' ""(5) Use  of the strategy and tactics of the people's war as interpreted by Mao Tse-tung , in a protracted armed struggle to annihilate the  enemy and take over state power, based on the support of a mobilized mass  population and the use of guerrilla warfare, and ultimately mobile and even  positional warfare as the revolution progresses."" ""(6) Adherence to a policy of self-reliance , because 'revolution or people's war  in any country is the business of the masses in that country and should be  carried out primarily by their own efforts; and there is no other way.'"" (Peter Van Ness, Revolution and Chinese Foreign Policy , pp.  70-72.) 9 ""A report of the ' Palanan Incident' submitted by defense and military authorities to the House committee  on national defense said that no single incident had done so much to focus the  dangers posed by the 'reestablished' Communist Party of the Philippines and the  NPA than the discovery of an abandoned ship and the subsequent recovery of  military hardware and documents in innocent-looking Digoyo Bay. The discovery of these 'instruments  of war' which were intended for the insurgents was a cause of deep concern  because of its direct bearing on the national security, the report stated. "" Under  wraps . Before the Karagatan entered the picture, there had been  intelligence reports of increased NPA activities in the mountain areas and  shorelines of Palanan and nearby Dilasag-Casiguran in Quezon Province . Military authorities, for well-placed  reasons, had kept these reports under wraps. But a few of them leaked out. For  instance, a coded dispatch from Task Force Saranay mentioned a submarine unloaded some 200 men and while off Dinapique Point, north of Palanan . ""While skeptical newsmen  skimmed through the reports, they came across recorded instances of actual  operations: last May 19, a big number,  of NPA's arrived and encamped in the vicinity of the Divinisa River . On May 26, a ship unloaded about 200 sacks of  rice, firearms and ammunition at the vicinity of Digollorin . Shipside unloading was effected and cargo  ferried aboard small boats and bancas . ""Two days later on May 28, a  powerboat painted red, white and blue with a Philippine flag flying astern,  reconnoitered from Dinatadmo to Divinisa Point, Fishermen from barrio Maligaya , Palanan , were among those forced to unload food and  military supplies. About the second week  of June, another landing of supplies took place there. "" Programs  of action . By this time,  Brig. Gen. Tranquilino Paranis , Saranay commander, started to move some of his men  from task force headquarters in Echague , Isabela , to the Palanan area. On June 18, a patrol of the task  force encountered a group of NPA's in barrio Taringsing , Cordon town. Here government troops recovered CCP documents outlining programs of  action for 1972. The documents according  to military analysts, contained timetables calling for the intensification of  sabotage, violence and attacks on military camp and other government  installations from July to December. On  July 3, information was received that an unidentified vessel had been seen off Digoyo point. Paranis relayed the message to Brig. Gen. Tomas Diaz at  First PC Zone headquarters in Camp Olivas , Pampanga . From then on until army intelligence raided  the home of a sister of one of the incorporators of the Karagatan Fishing Co., in Cainta , Rizal and stumbled on stacks of communist propaganda materials, the Karagatan had exploded on the public face in bold glaring  headlines. ""What bothered army authorities  most was not only the actual landing of about 3,000 rifles of the M-14 type of  which 737 had already been recovered by troops who stormed Hill 225 in Palanan and also seized 60,000 rounds of ammunition and  another 30 boxes of ammunition for rocket launchers. It was the presence of the rockets  themselves. The 40mm rockets are high-explosive  anti-tank weapons. They appear to be  copies of the Soviet RPG-2 while the rocket launchers are prototypes of the  Soviet RPG-2 anti-tank launchers used by the Vietcong. ""The landing  of military hardware in enormous quantities have multiplied the dangers  of the CCP-Maoist factions, the military said. Armed with high powered weapons and with sufficient ammunition, the  insurgents have become a more potent force to contend with. This has emboldened them to intensify  operations with the use of new recruits. The new recruits have been trained in the use of high explosives and  were to be unleashed on the population centers of Greater Manila as part of the  continuing September-October plan that includes the bombing of Congress, the  Constitutional Convention, City Hall, public utilities, department stores and moviehouses . The  recruits were to seek sanctuary in safe houses installed for them by the NPA in Caloocan City ,  the army asserted.""

Revolution is, therefore, ""not a sudden episode but as the  consummation of a long process.""

An Army today has a  dispersion in depth quite unknown in our Civil War. Thus Under Secretary  of War Patterson, in stressing the need for a state guard to protect  installations in the rear, pointed to 'the fact that the wars of today know no  front line; that a tiny village hundreds of miles behind the theoretical front  may suddenly become the scene of desperate and blazing action.' If the problem  were to arise today it seems fair to assume that the Supreme Court would not  hold to the letter of Justice Davis' opinion. Just as in the construction of the commerce and other grants of national  power the Court of late has notably sought to make them adequate to the  conditions which we face, almost certainly it would so construe the war power  as to include all that is requisite 'to wage war successfully.'""

(J. Randall & D.  Donald, The Civil War and Reconstruction, 301 [1961]. It must be noted that the  Habeas Corpus Act of 1863 of the United States required that lists of political  prisoners be furnished to the judges of the federal courts; limited the  duration of detention to one session of the grand jury, at the end of which  courts were to order the release of those prisoners who had not been indicted  for a crime. However, during the Civil  War the Habeas Corpus Act was virtually ignored by President Lincoln, and the  arrest, confinement, and release of prisoners continued as if it had not been  passed. [Lee], Randall  & D. Donald, supra , p. 306.) 2 There are three reasons advanced why this was found  necessary. ""First, the evidence to  satisfy the requirements of legal procedure will blow the cover of police  agents who have penetrated Communist open-front organizations. Further, the possibility of prosecution  assumes that participation in Communist conspiratorial activities is a legal  offence, which it is not in most countries. Third, to wait for the Communist activist to engage in overtly illegal  action, for example, riots and other sorts of violence before prosecution, will give them a political advantage which few  governments of the new states of Asia can afford. For by then the political situation would  have deteriorated to a state of acute instability, which in turn would probably  have caused economic decline due to loss of confidence. Should political instability become endemic,  serious doubts will creep into men's minds as to who would emerge the winner. This can make the problem of control of  subversion, for which public confidence and co-operation are important, a very  acute one. ""The power of arrest and  detention without trial is, therefore, a necessary weapon in the fight against  Communists in the newly established Asian states. It is, however, of the utmost importance that  the highest standards of conduct the on the part of the secret police are  maintained. There should checks, in the  form of review committees consisting of lawyers and professional men, on the  actions of the police. These checks  should be real and not perfunctory measures. Nothing would be more favourable to the growth  of Communist influence than extensive and indiscriminate use of the powers of  detention. For this  will generally cause widespread resentment against the authorities which the Communist  underground can use to stoke the fires of revolution. Further, it is important that police action  is limited to really worthwhile targets — the thinkers and the planners, the  able propagandists and the organization men. Ninety-nine per cent of those who engage in Communist open-front  activities are not worth detaining, not even the second echelon activists and  the musclemen on whom the Communists depend to discipline their followers. They are the expendables and can be replaced  without much difficulty, unlike the thinker and the plotter, and their  detention serves no purpose beyond creating unnecessary disaffection among  their families.""

CONCURRING OPINION BARREDO, J .: It is to my mind very unfortunate that, for reasons I cannot  comprehend or do not deem convincing, the majority of the Court has agreed that  no main opinion be prepared for the decision in these cases. Honestly, I feel that the grounds given by  the Chief Justice do not justify a deviation from the regular practice of a  main opinion being prepared by one Justice even when the members of the Court  are not all agreed as to the grounds of the judgment as long as at least a  substantial number of Justices concur in the basic ones and there are enough  other Justices concurring in the result to form the required majority. I do not see such varying substantial  disparity in the views of the members of the Court regarding the different  issues here as to call for a summarization like the one that was done, with  controversial consequences, in Javellana. (a) Actually, the summarization made  by the Chief Justice does not in my opinion portray accurately the spectrum of  our views, if one is to assay the doctrinal value of this decision. The divergences stated are I think more  apparent than real. In any event, it is my considered view that a historical decision  like this, one likely to be sui generis , at the same time that it is of  utmost transcendental importance because it revolves around the proper  construction of the constitutional provisions securing individual rights as  they may be affected by those empowering the Government to defend itself  against the threat of internal and external aggression, as these are actually  operating in the setting of the official proclamation of the Executive that  rebellion endangering public safety actually exists, deserves better treatment  from the Court. Indeed, I believe that  our point of seeming variance respecting the questions, before us could have  been threshed out, if only enough effort in that direction had been exerted by  all. The trouble is that from the very  beginning many members of the Court, myself included, announced our desire to  have our views recorded for history, hence, individualization rather than  consensus became the order of the day. In consequence, the convenient solution was forged that as long as there  would be enough votes to support a legally binding, judgment, here need not be  any opinion of the Court, everyone could give his own views and the Chief  Justice would just try to analyze the opinions of those who would care to  prepare one and then make a certification, of the final result of the voting. It was only at the last minute that, at my  suggestion, supported by Justice Castro, the Chief's prepared certification was  modified to assume the form of a judgment, thereby giving this decision a  better semblance of respectability. As will be seen, this separate opinion of concurrence is not due  to any irreconcilable conflict of conviction between me and any other member of  the Court. Truth to tell, at the early  stages of our efforts to decide these cases, but after the Court had more or  less already arrived at a consensus as to the result, I was made to understand  that I could prepare the opinion for the Court. Apparently, however, for one reason or another, some of our colleagues  felt that it is unnecessary to touch on certain matters contained in the draft  I had submitted, incomplete and unedited as it was, hence, the plan was  abandoned. My explanation that a  decision of this import should be addressed in part to the fixture and should  attempt to answer, as best we can, not only the questions raised by the parties  but also the relevant ones that we are certain are bothering many of our  countrymen, not to speak of those who are interested in the correct juridical  implications of the unusual political developments being witnessed in the  Philippines these days, failed to persuade them. I still feel very strongly, however, the need  for articulating the thoughts that will enable the whole world to visualize and  comprehend the exact length, breadth and depth of the juridical foundations of  the current constitutional order and thus be better positioned to render its  verdict thereon. The following then is the draft of the opinion I prepared for the  Court. I feel I need not adjust it to  give it the tenor of an individual opinion. Something inside me dictates that I should let it stand as I had  originally prepared it. I am emboldened  to do this by the conviction that actually, when properly analyzed, it will be  realized that whatever differences there might be in the various opinions we  are submitting individually, such differences lie only in the distinctive  methods of approach we have each prepared to adopt rather than in any basically  substantial and irreconcilable disagreement. If we had only striven a little more, I am confident, we could have even  found a common mode of approach. I am  referring, of course, only to those of Us who sincerely feel the urgency of  resolving the fundamental issues herein, regardless of purely technical and  strained reasons there might be to apparently justify an attitude of  indifference, if not concealed antagonism, to the need for authoritative  judicial clarification of the juridical aspects of the New Society in the  Philippines. On September 11, 1974 ,  petitioner Diokno was released by order of the President, ""under existing  rules and regulations."" The Court has, therefore, resolved that his  particular case has become moot and academic, but this development has not  affected the issues insofar as the other petitioners, particularly Senator  Aquino, are concerned. And inasmuch as  the principal arguments of petitioner Diokno, although presented only in the  pleadings filed on his behalf, apply with more or less equal force to the other  petitioners, I feel that my reference to and discussion of said arguments in my  draft may well be preserved, if only to maintain the purported  comprehensiveness of my treatment of all the important aspects of these cases. Before proceeding any further, however, I would like to explain  why I am saying we have no basic disagreements. Except for Justices Makasiar and Esguerra who consider the  recitals in the Proclamation to be absolutely conclusive upon the courts and  for Justice Teehankee who considers it unnecessary to express any opinion on  the matter at this point, the rest or eight of us have actually inquired into  the constitutional sufficiency of the Proclamation. Where we have differed is only as to the  extent and basis of the inquiry. Without  committing themselves expressly as to whether the issue is justiciable or  otherwise, the Chief Justice and Justice Castro unmistakably appear to have  actually conducted an inquiry which as far as I can see is based on facts which  are uncontradicted in the record plus additional facts of judicial notice. No independent evidence has been considered,  nor is any reference made to the evidence on which the President had  acted. On their part, Justices Antonio,  Fernandez and Aquino are of the view that the Proclamation is not subject to  inquiry by the courts, but assuming it is, they are of the conviction that the  record amply supports the reasonableness, or lack of arbitrariness, of the  President's action. Again, in arriving  at this latter conclusion, they have relied exclusively on the same factual  bases utilized by the Chief Justice and Justice Castro. Justices Fernando and Muñoz Palma  categorically hold that the issue is justiciable and, on that premise, they  made their own inquiry, but with no other basis than the same undisputed facts  in the record and facts of judicial notice from which the others have drawn  their conclusions. For myself, I am just  making it very clear that the inquiry which the Constitution contemplates for  the determination of the constitutional sufficiency of a proclamation of  martial law by the President should not go beyond facts of judicial notice and  those that may be stated in the proclamation, if these are by their very nature  capable of unquestionable demonstration. In other words, eight of us virtually hold that the Executive's  Proclamation is not absolutely conclusive — but it is not to be interfered with  whenever it accords with facts undisputed in the record as well as those of  judicial notice or capable of unquestionable demonstration. Thus, it is obvious that although we are  split between upholding justiciability or non-justiciability, those who believe  in the latter have nonetheless conducted an inquiry, while those who adhere to  the former theory, insisting on following Lansang, have limited their inquiry  to the uncontroverted facts and facts of judicial notice. Indeed, the truth is that no one has asked  for inquiry into the evidence before the President which is what the real  import of justiciability means. In the  final analysis, none of us has gone beyond what in my humble opinion the  Constitution permits in the premises. In  other words, while a declaration of martial law is not absolutely conclusive,  the Court's inquiry into its constitutional sufficiency may not, contrary to  what is implied in Lansang, involve the reception of evidence to be weighed  against those on which the President has acted, nor may it extend to the  investigation of what evidence the President had before him. Such inquiry must be limited to what is  undisputed in the record and to what accords or does not accord with facts of  judicial notice. Following now is my separate concurring opinion which as I have  said is the draft I submitted to the Court's approval: This is a cluster of petitions for habeas corpus seeking the  release of petitioners from detention, upon the main ground that, allegedly,  Proclamation 1081 issued by President Ferdinand E. Marcos on September 21, 1972  placing the whole country under martial law as well as the general orders  subsequently issued also by the President by virtue of the said proclamation,  pursuant to which petitioners have been apprehended and detained, two of them  until the present, while the rest have been released conditionally, are  unconstitutional and null and void, hence their arrest and detention have no  legal basis. The petitioners in G.R. No. L-35538 are all journalist, namely,  Joaquin P. Roces, Teodoro M. Locsin, Rolando Fadul, Rosalind Galang, Go Eng  Guan, Maximo M. Soliven, Renato Constantino and Luis R. Mauricio. Their petition was filed at about noon of September   23, 1972 . Almost three hours later of the same day, the petition in G.R.  No. L-35539 was filed, with Carmen I. Diokno, as petitioner, acting on behalf  of her husband, Jose W. Diokno, a senator, who is one of those still detained. Two days later, early in the morning of September 25, 1972 , the petition of Maximo V.  Soliven, Napoleon G. Rama and Jose Mari Velez, all media men, was docketed as  G.R. No. L-35540. The last two were also  delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1971. In all the three foregoing cases, the proper writs of habeas  corpus were issued returnable not later than 4:00   p.m. of September 25, 1972 ,  and hearing of the petitions was held on September 26, 1972 . [1] Late in the afternoon of September   25, 1972 , another petition was filed on behalf of Senators Benigno  S. Aquino, Jr. and Ramon V. Mitra, Jr., and former Senator Francisco  ""Soc"" Rodrigo, also a TV commentator. (Delegate Napoleon Rama also appears as petitioner in this case.) It was  docketed as G.R. No. L-35546. The next day, September   26, 1972 , a petition was filed by Voltaire Garcia II, another  delegate to the Constitutional Convention, as G.R. No. L-35547. [2] In these two cases the writs prayed for were also issued and the  petitions were heard together on September   29, 1972 . In G.R. No. L-35556, the petition was filed by Tan Chin Hian and  Veronica L. Yuyitung on September 27,   1972 , but the same was withdrawn by the latter on October 6, 1972 and the former on October 9, 1972 , since they were  released from custody on September 30,   1972 and October 9, 1972 ,  respectively. The Court allowed the  withdrawals by resolution on October   11, 1972 . On October 2, 1972, the petition of journalists Amando Doronila,  Juan L. Mercado, Hernando J. Abaya, Ernesto Granada, Luis Beltran, Tan Chin  Hian, (already a petitioner in G. R. No. L-35556) Bren Guiao, (for whom a  subsequent petition was also filed by his wife in G. R. No. L-35571, but both  petitions on his behalf were immediately withdrawn with the approval of the  Court which was given by resolution on October   11, 1972 ) Ruben Cusipag, Roberto Ordoñez, Manuel Almario and Willie  Baun was filed in G.R. No. L-35567. All  these petitioners, except Juan L. Mercado, Manuel Almario and Roberto Ordoñez  withdrew their petitions and the Court allowed the withdrawals by resolutions  of October 3 and 11, 1972. And on October 3, 1972 ,  Ernesto Rondon, also a delegate to the Constitutional Convention and a radio  commentator, filed his petition in G.R. No. L-35573. Again, in all these last four cases, G.R. Nos. L-35556, 35567,  35571 and 35573, the corresponding writs were issued and a joint hearing  of the petitions was held October 6,   1972 , except as to the petitioners who had as of then announced the  withdrawal of their respective petitions. The returns and answers of the Solicitor General in all these  nine cases, filed on behalf of the principal respondents, the Secretary of  National Defense, Hon. Juan Ponce Enrile, the Chief of Staff of the Armed  Forces of the Philippines ,  General Romeo Espino, and the Chief of the Philippine Constabulary, General  Fidel V. Ramos, were practically identical as follows: ""RETURN  TO WRIT and ANSWER TO THE PETITION COME NOW respondents, by the undersigned counsel, and appearing  before this Honorable Court only for purposes of this action, as hereunder set  forth, hereby state by way of return to the writ and answer to the petition, as  follows: ADMISSIONS/DENIALS 1. They ADMIT the allegations in paragraphs I  and V of the Petition; 2. They ADMIT the allegations in paragraph II of  the Petition that the petitioners were arrested on September 22, 1972 and are  presently detained at Fort Bonifacio, Makati, Rizal, but SPECIFICALLY DENY the  allegation that their detention is illegal, the truth being that stated in the  Special and Affirmative Defenses of this Answer and Return; 3. They SPECIFICALLY DENY the allegations in  paragraphs III, IV, VI and VII, of the Petition, the truth of the matter being  that stated in the Special and Affirmative Defenses of this Answer and Return. Respondents state by way of SPECIAL AND  AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES 4. On September 21, 1972, the President of the  Philippines, in the exercise of the powers vested in him by Article VII,  section 10, paragraph 2 of the Constitution, issued Proclamation No. 1081  placing the entire Philippines under martial law; 5. Pursuant to said Proclamation, the President  issued General Orders Nos. 1, 2, 3, 3­A, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and Letters of  Instruction Nos. 1, 2 and 3. True copies  of these documents are hereto attached and made integral parts hereof as  Annexes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. A copy of the President's statement to the country on September 23, 1972 is also attached  as Annex 12; 6. Finally, the petition states no cause of  action. P R A Y E R IN VIEW WHEREOF, it is respectfully prayed of this Honorable  Supreme Court that the petition be dismissed. Manila , Philippines , September 27, 1972 ."" At the hearings, the following well-known and distinguished  members of the bar appeared and argued for the petitioners: Petitioner Diokno argued on his own behalf to  supplement the arguments of his counsel of record; Attys. Joker D. Arroyo  appeared and argued for the petitioners in L-35538 and L-35567; Francis E.  Garchitorena, assisted by Oscar Diokno Perez, appeared and argued for the petitioner  in L-35539; Ramon A. Gonzales, assisted by Manuel B. Imbong, appeared and  argued for the petitioners in L-35540; Senators Gerardo Roxas and Jovito R.  Salonga, assisted by Attys. Pedro L. Yap, Sedfrey A. Ordonez, Custodio O.  Parlade, Leopoldo L. Africa, Francisco Rodrigo Jr., Magdaleno Palacol and  Dakila F. Castro, appeared and argued for the petitioners in L-35546; Atty. E.  Voltaire Garcia, Sr. appeared and argued in behalf of his petitioner son in  L-35547; Attys. Raul I. Goco and Teodulo R. Diño appeared for the petitioners  in L-35556; Atty. Roberto P. Tolentino appeared for the petitioner in L-35571;  and Atty. Aquilino Pimentel Jr. assisted by Atty. Modesto R. Galias Jr.  appeared and argued for the petitioner in L­35578. On October 31, 1972 ,  former Senator Lorenzo M. Tañada, together with his lawyer-sons, Attorneys  Renato and Wigberto Tañada, entered their appearance as counsel for all the  petitioners in G.R. No. L-35538, except Fadul, Galang and Go Eng Guan, for  petitioner Diokno in G.R. No. L-35539 and for petitioners Aquino, Mitra,  Rodrigo and Rama in G.R. No. L-35546. For the respondents, Solicitor General Estelito P. Mendoza,  Assistant Solicitors General Bernardo P. Pardo and Rosalio A. de Leon (both of  whom are judges now), Solicitor Reynato S. Puno (now Assistant Solicitor  General) and Solicitors Jose A.R. Melo and Jose A. Janolo appeared in all the  cases, but only the Solicitor General argued. Later, Assistant Solicitor General Vicente V. Mendoza also appeared and  co-signed all the subsequent pleadings and memoranda for respondents. After the hearing of September 26 and 29 and October 6, 1972 , the parties were required to  file their respective memoranda. On November 9, 1972 petitioners in all  the cases filed their consolidated 109-page memorandum, together with the  answers, contained in 86 pages, to some 33 questions posed by the Court in its  resolution of September 29, 1972 ,  and later, on December 1, 1972 ,  an 88-page reply to the memorandum of respondents, with annexes. In a separate Manifestation of Compliance and  Submission filed simultaneously with their reply, petitioners stressed that: ""4. That undersigned counsel for Petitioners did  not ask for any extension of the period within which to file the Reply  Memorandum for Petitioners, despite overwhelming pressure of work, because — a. everyday of delay would mean one day more of  indescribable misery and anguish on the part of Petitioners and their families; b. any further delay would only diminish  whatever time is left — more than a month's time — within which this Court can  deliberate on and decide these petitions, having in mind some irreversible  events which may plunge this nation into an entirely new constitutional order,  namely, the approval of the draft of the proposed Constitution by the  Constitutional Convention and the 'plebiscite' scheduled on January 15, 1973; c. the proposed Constitution, if 'ratified',  might prejudice these petitions, in view of the following transitory provision: 'All proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions, and acts  promulgated, issued, or done by the incumbent President shall be part of the  law of the land, and shall remain valid, legal, binding, and effective even  after the lifting of martial law or the ratification of this Constitution,  unless modified, revoked, or superseded by subsequent proclamations, decrees,  instructions, or other acts of the incumbent President, or unless expressly and  explicitly modified or repealed by the regular National Assembly. (Article XVII, sec. 3, par. 2 of the proposed  Constitution). ""5. In view of the fact that they were arrested  and detained allegedly in keeping with the existing Constitution, it is only  humane and just that these petitions . . . to be accorded preference under Rule  22, section 1 of the Rules of Court . . . be disposed of while there is still  time left, in accordance with the present Constitution and not in accordance  with a new constitutional order being ushered in, under the aegis of a martial  rule, the constitutionality and validity of which is the very point at issue in  the instant petitions; ""6. Since, according to the unanimous view of  the authorities, as cited in their Memorandum, the overriding purpose of  martial law is . . . and cannot go beyond . . . the preservation of the constitutional  status quo , and not to alter it or hasten its alteration, it would be  extremely unjust and inhuman, to say the least, to allow these petitions for  the great writ of liberty to be imperiled, by virtue of a new Constitution . .  . 'submission' and 'ratification' of which are being pressed under martial law  . . . that would purportedly ratify all Executive edicts issued and acts done  under said regime . . . something that has never been done as far as is known  in the entire history of the Anglo-American legal system;"" (pp. 414­-416,  Rollo, L-35539.) At this juncture, it may be stated that as of October 11, 1972,  the following petitioners had already withdrawn: Amando Doronila, Hernando J. Abaya, Ernesto  Granada, Luis Beltran, Bren Guiao, Ruben Cusipag, Willie Baun, Tan Chin Hian  and Veronica L. Yuyitung; hence, of the original nine cases with a total of 32  petitioners, [3] only the six above-entitled cases remain with 18 petitioners. [4] The remaining petitioners are: Joaquin  P. Roces, Teodoro M. Locsin, Sr., Rolando Fadul, Rosalind Galang, Go Eng Guan,  Maximo V. Soliven, Renato Constantino, Luis R. Mauricio, Jose W. Diokno thru  Carmen Diokno, Napoleon G. Rama, Jose Mari Velez, Benigno S. Aquino, Ramon V.  Mitra, Jr., Francisco S. Rodrigo, Juan L. Mercado, Roberto Ordonez, Manuel  Almario and Ernesto Rondon, but only Senators Diokno and Aquino are still in  confinement, the rest having been released under conditions hereinafter to be  discussed. The case of petitioner Garcia  in G.R. No. L-35547 is deemed abated on account of his death. Over the opposition of these remaining petitioners, respondents  counsel was given several extensions of their period to file their memorandum,  and it was not until January 10, 1973 that they were able to file their reply of 35 pages. Previously, their memorandum of 77 pages was  filed on November 17, 1972 . Thus, the cases were declared submitted for  decision only on February 26, 1973 ,  per resolution of even date, only to be reopened later, as will be stated anon. In the meanwhile, practically the same counsel for petitioners in  these cases engaged the government lawyers in another and separate  transcendental judicial tussle of two stages relative to the New  Constitution. On December 7, 1972 , the first of the so-called  Plebiscite Cases (G.R. No. L-35925, Charito Planas vs . Comelec, G. R.  No. L-35929, Pablo C. Sanidad vs . Comelec, G. R. No. L-35940, Gerardo  Roxas et al. vs . Comelec, G. R. No. L-­35941, Eddie B. Monteclaro vs .  Comelec, G. R. No. L­-35942, Sedfrey A. Ordonez vs . Treasurer, G. R. No.  L-­35948. Vidal Tan vs . Comelec,  G. R. No. L-35953, Jose W. Diokno et als. vs . Comelec, G. R. No.  L-35961, Jacinto Jimenez vs . Comelec, G. R. No. L-35965, Raul M.  Gonzales vs . Comelec and G. R. No. L-35979, Ernesto Hidalgo vs .  Comelec) was filed. These cases took  most of the time of the Court until January   22, 1973 , when they were declared moot and academic because of the  issuance of Proclamation 1102 on January   17, 1973 , but on January   20, 1973 , as a sequel to the Plebiscite Cases, Josue Javellana  filed Case No. G. R. No. L-36142 against the Executive Secretary and the  Secretaries of National Defense, Justice and Finance. This started the second series of cases known  as the Ratification Cases, namely, said G. R. No. L-36142 and G. R. No.  L-36164, Vidal Tan vs . The Executive Secretary et al., G.R. No. L-­36165,  Gerardo Roxas et al. vs . Alejandro Melchor etc. et al., G. R. No.  L-36236, Eddie B. Monteclaro vs . The Executive Secretary, and G. R. No.  L-36283, Napoleon V. Dilag vs . The Honorable Executive Secretary. The main thrust of these petitions was that  the New Constitution had not been validly ratified, hence the Old Constitution  continued in force and, therefore, whatever provisions the New Constitution  might contain tending to validate the proclamations, orders, decrees, and acts  of the incumbent President which are being relied upon for the apprehension and  detention of petitioners, have no legal effect. In any event, the advent of a new constitution naturally entailed the  consequence that any question as to the legality of the continued detention of  petitioners or of any restraint of their liberties may not be resolved without  taking into account in one way or another the pertinent provisions of the new  charter. Accordingly, the resolution of  these two series of cases became a prejudicial matter which the Court had to  resolved first. It was not until March 31, 1973 that they were decided  adversely to the petitioners therein and it was only on April 17, 1973 that entry of final judgment was  made therein. From April 18, 1973 ,  the membership of the Court was depleted to nine, in view of the retirement,  effective on said date, of then Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion. With its nine remaining members, doubts were  expressed as to whether or not the Court could act on constitutional matters of  the nature and magnitude of those raised in these cases, the required quorum  for the resolution of issues of unconstitutionality under the New Constitution  being ten members. (Section 2(2),  Article IX, Constitution of the Philippines of 1973). Prescinding from this point, it is a fact  that even if it is not required expressly by the Constitution, by the Court's  own policy which the Constitution authorizes it to adopt, all cases involving  constitutional questions are heard en banc in which the quorum and at  the same time the binding vote is of eight Justices. With only nine members out of a possible  membership of fifteen, it was not exactly fair for all concerned that the Court  should act, particularly in a case which in truth does not involve only those  who are actual parties therein but the whole people as well as the Government  of the Philippines . So, the Court, even as it went on informally  discussing these cases from time to time, preferred to wait for the appointment  and qualification of new members, which took place only on October 29, 1973,  when Justices Estanislao Fernandez, Cecilia Muñoz Palma and Ramon Aquino joined  the Court. Meantime, subsequent to the resolution of February 26, 1973 , declaring these cases  submitted for decision, or, more particularly on June 29, 1973 , counsel for petitioner Carmen I. Diokno in  G.R. No. L-35539 filed a 99-page Supplemental Petition and Motion for Immediate  Release which the Court had to refer to the respondents, on whose behalf, the  Solicitor General filed an answer on July   30, 1973 . On August 14,  1973, counsel for petitioner Diokno filed a motion asking that the said  petition and motion be set for hearing, which the Court could not do, in view  precisely of the question of quorum. As  a matter of fact, in the related case of Benigno S. Aquino, Jr. vs. Military  Commission No. 2, et al., G.R. No. L-37364, further reference to which will be  made later, a preliminary hearing had to be held by the Court on Sunday, August 24, 1973 , on the sole  question of whether or not with its membership of nine then, the Court could  act on issues of constitutionality of the acts of the President. At this point, it may be mentioned incidentally that thru several  repeated manifestations and motions, Counsel Francis E. Garchitorena of  petitioner Diokno invited the attention of the Court not only to alleged denial  to his client of ""the essential access of and freedom to confer and  communicate with counsel"" but also to alleged deplorable subhuman  conditions surrounding his detention. And in relation to said manifestations and motions, on February 19,  1973, said petitioner, Diokno, together with petitioner Benigno S. Aquino and  joined by their common counsel, Senator Lorenzo M. Tañada, filed with this  Court a petition for mandamus praying that respondents be commanded ""to  permit petitioner Tañada to visit and confer freely and actively with  petitioners Diokno and Aquino at reasonable hours pursuant to the provisions of  RA 857 and RA 1083 and in pursuance of such decision, (to direct said  respondents) (1) to clear the conference room of petitioners of all  representatives of the Armed Forces and all unwanted third persons, and  prohibit their presence; (2) to remove or cause the removal of all listening  devices and other similar electronic equipment from the conference room of  petitioners, with the further direction that no such instruments be hereafter  installed, and (3) to desist from the practice of examining (a) the notes taken  by petitioner Tañada of his conferences with petitioners Diokno and Aquino; and  (b) such other legal documents as petitioner Tañada may bring with him for  discussion with said petitioners."" (G. R. No. L-36315). For obvious reasons, said petition will be  resolved in a separate decision. It may  be stated here, however, that in said G. R. No. L-­36315, in attention to the  complaint made by Senator Tañada in his Reply dated April 2, 1973, that  Mesdames Diokno and Aquino were not being allowed to visit their husbands, and,  worse, their very whereabouts were not being made known to them, on April 6,  1973, after hearing the explanations of counsel for therein respondents, the  Court issued the following resolution: ""Upon humanitarian considerations, the Court RESOLVED  unanimously to grant, pending further action by this Court, that portion of the  prayer in petitioners' 'Supplement and/or Amendment to Petition' filed on April  6, 1973 that the wives and minor children of petitioners Diokno and Aquino be  allowed to visit them, subject to such precautions as respondents may deem  necessary."" We have taken pains to recite all the circumstances surrounding  the progress of these cases from their inception in order to correct the  impression, conveyed by the pleadings of petitioner Diokno, that their  disposition has been unnecessarily, if not deliberately, delayed. The Court cannot yield to anyone in being  concerned that individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the fundamental  law of the land are duly protected and safeguarded. It is fully cognizant of how important not  only to the petitioners but also to the maintenance of the rule of law is the  issue of legality of the continued constraints on the freedoms of petitioners. Under ordinary circumstances, it does not  really take the Court much time to determine whether a deprivation of personal  liberty is legal or illegal. But, aside  from the unusual procedural setbacks related above, it just happens that the  basic issues to resolve here do not affect only the individual rights of  petitioners. Indeed, the importance of  these cases transcends the interest of those who, like petitioners, have come  to the Court. Actually, what is directly  involved here is the issue of the legality of the existing government  itself. Accordingly, We have to act with  utmost care. Besides, in a sense, the  legality of the Court's own existence is also involved here, and We do not want  anyone to even suspect We have hurried precipitately to uphold Ourselves. In addition to these considerations, it must be borne in mind  that there are thousands of other cases in the Court needing its continued  attention. With its clogged docket, the  Court, could ill afford to give petitioners any preference that would entail  corresponding injustice to other litigants before it. What is more, under the New Constitution, the administrative  jurisdiction over all lower courts, including the Court of Appeals, has been  transferred from the Department of Justice to the Supreme Court, and because  that Department refrained from attending to any administrative function over  the courts since January 17, 1973, on April 18, 1973, after the Ratification  Cases became final, We found in Our hands a vast accumulation of administrative  matters which had to be acted upon without further delay, if the smooth and  orderly functioning of the courts had to be maintained. And, of course, the Court has to continuously  attend to its new administrative work from day to day, what with all kinds of complaints  and charges being filed daily against judges, clerks of courts and other  officers and employees of the different courts all over the country, which the  Court en banc has to tackle It should not be surprising at all that a  great portion of our sessions en banc has to be devoted to the consideration  and disposition of such administrative matters. Furthermore, in this same connection account must also be taken  of the fact that the transfer of the administrative functions of the Department  to the Court naturally entailed problems and difficulties which consumed Our  time, if only because some of the personnel had to acquaint themselves with the  new functions entrusted to them, while corresponding adjustments had to be made  in the duties and functions of the personnel affected by the transfer. PRELIMINARY ISSUES Now, before proceeding to the discussion and resolution of the  issues in the pending petitions, two preliminary matters call for disposition,  namely, first, the motion of petitioner Jose W. Diokno, thru counsel Senator  Tañada, to be allowed to withdraw his basic petition and second, the objection  of petitioner, Francisco ""Soc"" Rodrigo, to the Court's considering  his petition as moot and academic as a consequence of his having been released  from his place of confinement in Fort Bonifacio. Related to the latter is the express  manifestation of the other petitioners: Joaquin P. Roces, Teodoro M. Locsin, Sr., Rolando Fadul, Rosalind  Galang, Go Eng Guan, Maximo V. Soliven, Renato Constantino, Luis R. Mauricio,  Napoleon G. Rama, Jose Mari Velez, Ramon. V. Mitra, Jr., Juan L. Mercardo,  Roberto Ordoñez, Manuel Almario and Ernesto Rondon, to the effect that they  remain as petitioners, notwithstanding their having been released (under the  same conditions as those imposed on petitioner Rodrigo), thereby implying that  they are not withdrawing, as, in fact, they have not withdrawn their petitions  and would wish them resolved on their merits. (Manifestation of counsel for petitioners dated March 15, 1974.) I Anent petitioner Diokno's motion to withdraw, only seven members  of the Court, namely, Chief Justice Makalintal, and Justices Zaldivar,  Fernando, Teehankee, Muñoz Palma, Aquino and the writer of this opinion, voted  to grant the same. Said number being  short of the eight votes required for binding action of the Court en banc even in an incident, pursuant to Section 11 of Rule 56, the said motion is  denied, without prejudice to the right of each member of the Court to render  his individual opinion in regard to said motion. [5] One of the reasons vigorously advanced by petitioner Diokno in  his motion to withdraw is that he cannot submit his case to the Supreme Court  as it is presently constituted, because it is different from the one in which  he filed his petition, and that, furthermore, he is invoking, not the present  or New Constitution of the Philippines the incumbent justices have now sworn to  protect and defend but the Constitution of 1935 [6] under which they were serving before. Indeed, in the ""Manifestation of Compliance and Submission""  filed by his counsel as early as December 1, 1973, a similar feeling was  already indicated, as may be gathered from the portions thereof quoted earlier  in this opinion. Had petitioner reiterated and insisted on the position asserted  by him in said manifestation shortly after the ratification of the New  Constitution on January 17, 1973 or even later, after the decision of this  Court in the Ratification Cases became final on April 17, 1973, perhaps, there  could have been some kind of justification for Our then and there declaring his  petition moot and academic, considering his personal attitude of refusing to  recognize the passing out of the 1935 Constitution and of the Supreme Court  under it. But the fact is that as late  as June 29, 1973, more than six months after the ratification of the New  Constitution and more than two months after this Court had declared that  ""there is no more judicial obstacle to the New Constitution being  considered as in force and effect"", petitioner Diokno, thru counsel  Tañada, filed a ""Supplemental Petition and Motion for Immediate  Release"" wherein nary a word may be found suggesting the point that both  the Constitution he is invoking and the Court he has submitted his petition to  have already passed into inexistence. On  the contrary, he insisted in this last motion that ""an order be issued (by  this Court) directing respondents to immediately file charges against him if  they have evidence supporting the same."" Be it noted, in this connection,  that by resolution of the Court of June 1, 1973, it had already implemented the  provisions on the Judiciary of the New Constitution and had constituted itself  with nine members into the first Division, thereby making it unmistakably clear  that it was already operating as the Supreme Court under the New Constitution. The fact now capitalized by petitioner that  the Justices took the oath only on October 29, 1973 is of no significance, the  truth being that neither the Justices continuation in office after the New  Constitution took effect nor the validity or propriety of the Court’s  resolution of June 1, 1973 just mentioned were questioned by him before.  Accordingly, the allegation in his motion to withdraw relative to the New  Constitution and the present Supreme Court appear to be obvious afterthoughts  intended only to lend color to his refusal to have the issue of alleged  illegality of his detention duly resolved, realizing perchance the untenability  thereof and the inevitability of the denial of his petition, albeit none of  this will ever be admitted, as may be gathered from his manifestation that he  would not want to have anything to do with any ruling of the Court adverse to  his pretensions. Just the same, the new oaths of the Justices and the  applicability hereto of the Old and the New Constitution will be discussed in  another part of this opinion, if only to satisfy the curiosity of petitioner. Although the other petitioners have not joined the subject  withdrawal motion, it might just as well be stated, for whatever relevant  purpose it may serve, that with particular reference to petitioner Rodrigo, as  late as November 27, 1973, after three new justices were added to the  membership of the Court in partial obedience to the mandate of the New  Constitution increasing its total membership to fifteen, and after the Court  had, by resolution of November 15, 1973, already constituted itself into two  divisions of six Justices each, said petitioner filed a Manifestation ""for  the purpose of showing that, insofar as (he) herein petitioner is concerned,  his petition for habeas corpus is not moot and academic."" Notably,  this manifestation deals specifically with the matter of his ""conditional  release"" as being still a ground for habeas corpus but does not  even suggest the fundamental change of circumstances relied upon in petitioner  Diokno's motion to withdraw. On the contrary, said manifestation indicates  unconditional submission of said petitioner to the jurisdiction of this Court  as presently constituted. Of similar  tenor is the manifestation of counsel for the remaining petitioners in these  cases dated March 15, 1974 . In other words, it appears quite clearly that  petitioners should be deemed as having submitted to the jurisdiction of the  Supreme Court as it is presently constituted in order that it may resolve their  petitions for habeas corpus even in the light of the provisions of the  New Constitution. II Coming now to the conditions attached to the release of the  petitioners other than Senators Diokno and Aquino, it is to be noted that they  were all given identical release papers reading as follows: ""HEADQUARTERS 5TH MILITARY  INTELLIGENCE GROUP, ISAFP Camp General  Emilio Aguinaldo Quezon    City M56P 5   December 1972 SUBJECT:  Conditional Release TO: Francisco Soc Rodrigo 1. After having been arrested and detained for subversion  pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081 of the President of the Philippines in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines ,  dated 21 September 1972 ,  you are hereby conditionally released. 2. You are advised to abide strictly with the  provisions of Proclamation No. 1081 and the ensuing LOIs. Any violation of these provisions would  subject you to immediate arrest and confinement. 3. Your investigation will continue following a  schedule which you will later on be informed. You are advised to follow this schedule strictly. ""4. You are not allowed to leave the confines of  Greater Manila Area unless specifically authorized by this Office indicating  the provincial address and expected duration of stay thereat. Contact this Office through telephone No.  97-17-56 when necessary. 5. You are prohibited from giving or  participating in any interview conducted by any local or foreign mass media  representative for purpose of publication and/or radio/TV broadcast. 6. Be guided accordingly. (SGD.) MARIANO G.  MIRANDA Lt. Colonel PA Group Commander P L E D G E THIS IS TO CERTIFY that I have read and understood the foregoing  conditional release. I HEREBY PLEDGE to conduct myself accordingly and will not engage  in any subversive activity. I will  immediately report any subversive activity that will come to my knowledge. (SGD.)  F. RODRIGO Address: 60 Juana  Rodriguez Quezon    City Tel.  No.: 70-25-66; 70-49-20 70-27-55” It is the submission of these petitioners that their release  under the foregoing conditions is not absolute, hence their present cases  before the Court have not become moot and academic and should not be dismissed  without consideration of the merits thereof. They claim that in truth they have nut been freed, because actually,  what has been done to them is only to enlarge or expand the area of their  confinement in order to include the whole Greater Manila area instead of being  limited by the boundaries of the army camps wherein they were previously  detained. They say that although they  are allowed to go elsewhere, they can do so only if expressly and specifically  permitted by the army authorities, and this is nothing new, since they could  also go out of the camps before with proper passes. They maintain that they never accepted the  above conditions voluntarily. In other  words, it is their position that they are in actual fact being still so  detained and restrained of their liberty against their will as to entitle them  in law to the remedy of habeas corpus . We find merit in this particular submittal regarding the reach of habeas corpus . We readily agree  that the fundamental law of the land does not countenance the diminution or  restriction of their individual freedoms of any person in the Philippines without due process of law. No one in  this country may suffer, against his will, any kind or degree of constraint  upon his right to go to any place not prohibited by law, without being entitled  to this great writ of liberty, for it has not been designed only against  illegal and involuntary detention in jails, prisons and concentration camps,  but for all forms and degrees of restraint, without authority of law or the  consent of the person concerned, upon his freedom to move freely, irrespective  of whether the area within which he is small or large, as long as it is not  co-extensive with that which may be freely reached by anybody else, given the  desire and the means. More than half a  century ago in 1919, this Court already drew the broad and all-encompassing  scope of habeas corpus in these unequivocal words: ""A prime specification of an application  for a writ of habeas corpus is restraint of liberty. The essential object and purpose of the writ  of habeas corpus is to inquire into all manners of involuntary restraint  as distinguished from voluntary, and to relieve a person therefrom if such  restraint is illegal. Any restraint  which will preclude freedom of action is sufficient."" 6a There is no reason at all at this  time, hopefully there will never be any in the future, to detract a whit from  this noble attitude. Definitely, the  conditions under which petitioners have been released fall short of restoring  to them the freedom to which they are constitutionally entitled. Only a showing that the imposition of said  conditions is authorized by law can stand in the way of an order that they be  immediately and completely withdrawn by the proper authorities so that the  petitioners may again be free men as we are. And so, We mime to the basic question in these cases: Are petitioners being detained or otherwise  restrained of liberty, evidently against their will, without authority of law  and due process? THE FACTS Aside from those already made reference to above, the other  background facts of these cases are as follows: On September 21 1972 ,  President Ferdinand E. Marcos 7 signed the following proclamation: ""PROCLAMATION  NO. 1081 PROCLAIMING A STATE OF MARTIAL LAW IN THE PHILIPPINES WHEREAS, on the basis of carefully evaluated and verified  information, it is definitely established that lawless elements who are moved  by a common or similar ideological conviction, design, strategy and goal and  enjoying the active moral and material support of a foreign power and being  guided and directed by intensely devoted, well trained, determined and ruthless  groups of men and seeking refuge under the protection of our constitutional  liberties to promote and attain their ends, have entered into a conspiracy and  have in fact joined and banded their resources and forces together for the  prime purpose of, and in fact they have been and are actually staging,  undertaking and waging an armed insurrection and rebellion against the  Government of the Republic of the Philippines in order to forcibly seize  political and state power in this country, overthrow the duly constituted  Government, and supplant our existing political, social, economic and legal  order with an entirely new one whose form of government, whose system of laws,  whose conception of God and religion, whose notion of individual rights and family  relations, and whose political, social, economic, legal and moral precepts are  based on the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist teachings and beliefs; WHEREAS, these lawless elements, acting in concert through  seemingly innocent and harmless, although actually destructive, front  organizations which have been infiltrated or deliberately formed by them, have  continuously and systematically strengthened and broadened their memberships  through sustained and careful recruiting and enlistment of new adherents from among  our peasantry, laborers, professionals, intellectuals, students, and mass media  personnel, and through such sustained and careful recruitment and enlistment  have succeeded in spreading and expanding their control and influence over  almost every segment and level of our society throughout the land in their  ceaseless effort to erode and weaken the political, social, economic, legal and  moral foundations of our existing Government, and to influence, manipulate and  move peasant, labor, student and terroristic organizations under their  influence or control to commit, as in fact they have committed and still are  committing, acts of violence, depredations, sabotage and injuries against our  duly constituted authorities, against the members of our law enforcement agencies,  and worst of all, against the peaceful members of our society; WHEREAS, in the fanatical pursuit of their conspiracy and  widespread acts of violence, depredations, sabotage and injuries against our  people, and in order to provide the essential instrument to direct and carry  out their criminal design and unlawful activities, and to achieve their  ultimate sinister objectives, these lawless elements have in fact organized,  established and are now maintaining a Central Committee, composed of young and  dedicated radical students and intellectuals, which is charged with guiding and  directing the armed struggle and propaganda assaults against our duly  constituted Government, and this Central Committee is now imposing its will and  asserting its sham authority on certain segments of our population, especially  in the rural areas, through varied means of subterfuge, deceit, coercion,  threats, intimidations, machinations, treachery, violence and other modes of  terror, and has been and is illegally exacting financial and other forms of  tributes from our people to raise funds and material resources to support its  insurrectionary and propaganda activities against our duly constituted  Government and against our peace-loving people; WHEREAS, in order to carry out, as in fact they have carried out,  their premeditated plan to stage, undertake and wage a full scale armed  insurrection and rebellion in this country, these lawless elements have  organized, established and are now maintaining a well trained, well armed and highly  indoctrinated and greatly expanded insurrectionary force, popularly known as  the 'New People's Army,' which has since vigorously pursued and still is  vigorously pursuing a relentless and ruthless armed struggle against our duly  constituted Government and whose unmitigated forays, raids, ambuscades,  assaults and reign of terror and acts of lawlessness in the rural areas and in  our urban centers brought about the treacherous and cold-blooded assassination  of innocent civilians, military personnel of the Government and local public  officials in many parts of the country, notably in the Cagayan Valley, in  Central Luzon, in the Southern Tagalog Region, in the Bicol Area, in the  Visayas and in Mindanao, and whose daring and wanton guerrilla activities have generated  and sown fear and panic among our people, have created a climate of chaos and  disorder, produced a state of political, social, psychological, and economic  instability in our land, and have inflicted great suffering and irreparable injury to persons and property in  our society; WHEREAS, these lawless elements, their cadres, fellow-travellers,  friends, sympathizers and supporters have for many years up to the present time  been mounting sustained, massive and destructive propaganda assaults against our  duly constituted Government its instrumentalities, agencies and officials, and  also against our social, political, economic and religious institutions,  through the publications, broadcasts and disseminations of deliberately slanted  and overly exaggerated news stories and news commentaries as well as false,  vile, foul and scurrilous statements, utterances, writings and pictures through  the press-radio-television media and through leaflets, college campus  newspapers and some newspapers published and still being published by these  lawless elements, notably the 'Ang Bayan,' 'Pulang Bandila' and the 'Ang  Komunista,' all of which are clearly well-conceived, intended and calculated to  malign and discredit our duly constituted Government, its instrumentalities, agencies  and officials before our people, making it appear to the people that our  government has become so weak and so impotent to perform and discharge its  functions and responsibilities in our society and to our people, and thus  undermine and destroy the faith and loyalty and allegiance of our people in and  alienate their support for their duly  constituted Government, its instrumentalities, agencies and officials, and  thereby gradually erode and weaken as in fact they had so eroded and weakened  the will of our people to sustain and defend our Government and our democratic  way of life; WHEREAS, these lawless elements having taken up arms against our  duly constituted Government and against our people, and having committed and  are still committing acts of armed insurrection and rebellion consisting of  armed raids, forays, sorties, ambushes, wanton acts of murders, spoilage,  plunder, looting, arsons, destruction of public and private buildings, and  attacks against innocent and defenseless civilian lives and property, all of  which activities have seriously endangered and continue to endanger public  order and safety and the security of the nation, and acting with cunning and  manifest precision and deliberation and without regard to the health, safety  and well-being of the people, are now implementing their plan to cause  widespread, massive and systematic destruction and paralyzation of vital public utilities and services, particularly  water systems, sources of electrical power, communication and transportation  facilities, to the great detriment, suffering, injury and prejudice of our  people and the nation and to generate a deep psychological fear and panic among  our people; WHEREAS, the Supreme Court in the cases brought before it, docketed  as G.R. Nos. L-33964, L-33965, L-33973, L-33982, L-34004, L-34013, L-34039,  L-34265, and L-34339, as a consequence of the suspension of the privilege of  the writ of habeas corpus by me as President of the Philippines in my  Proclamation No. 889, dated August 21, 1971, as amended, has found that in  truth and in fact there exists an actual insurrection and rebellion in the  country by a sizeable group of men who have publicly risen in arms to overthrow  the Government. Here is what the Supreme  Court said in its decision promulgated on December 11, 1971 : '. . . our jurisprudence attests abundantly to the Communist  activities in the Philippines ,  especially in Manila , from the late  twenties to the early thirties, then aimed principally at incitement to  sedition or rebellion, as the immediate objective. Upon the establishment of the Commonwealth of  the Philippines, the movement seemed to have waned notably; but, the outbreak  of World War II in the Pacific and the miseries, the devastation and havoc, and  the proliferation of unlicensed firearms concomitant with the military  occupation of the Philippines and its subsequent liberation, brought about, in  the late forties, a resurgence of the Communist threat, with such vigor as to  be able to organize and operate in Central Luzon an army — called HUKBALAHAP,  during the occupation, and renamed Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan (HMB) after  liberation — which clashed several times with the Armed Forces of the  Republic. This prompted then President  Quirino to issue Proclamation No. 210, dated October 22, 1950 , suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus the validity of which was upheld in Montenegro vs . Castaneda. Days before the  promulgation of said Proclamation, or on October 18, 1950 , members of the Communist Politburo in  the Philippines were apprehended in Manila . Subsequently accused and convicted of the  crime of rebellion, they served their respective sentences. 'The fifties saw a comparative lull in Communist activities,  insofar as peace and order were concerned. Still, on June 20, 1957, Republic Act No. 1700, otherwise known as the  Anti-Subversion Act, was approved, upon the grounds stated in the very preamble  of said statute — that '. . . the Communist Party of the Philippines, although purportedly  a political party, is in fact an organized conspiracy to overthrow the  Government of the Republic of the Philippines, not only by force and violence  but also by deceit, subversion and other illegal means, for the purpose of  establishing in the Philippines a totalitarian regime subject to alien  domination and control; ‘. . . the continued existence and activities of the Communist  Party of the Philippines constitutes a clear, present and grave danger to the security of the Philippines ;  and '. . . in the face of the organized, systematic and persistent  subversion, national in scope but international in direction, posed by the  Communist Party of the Philippines and its activities, there is urgent need for  special legislation to cope with this continuing menace to the freedom and  security of the country. . .' ""In the language of the Report on Central Luzon ,  submitted, on September 4, 1971 ,  by the Senate Ad Hoc Committee of Seven — copy of which Report was filed in  these case by the petitioners herein — 'The years following 1963 saw the successive emergence in the  country of several mass organizations, notably the Lapiang Manggagawa (now the  Socialist Party of the Philippines) among the workers, the Malayang Samahan ng  mga Magsasaka (MASAKA) among the peasantry; the Kabataang Makabayan (KM) among  the youth/students; and the Movement for the Advancement of Nationalism (MAN)  among the intellectuals/professionals, the PKP has exerted all-out effort to  infiltrate, influence and utilize these organizations in promoting its radical  brand of nationalism.' ""Meanwhile, the Communist leaders in the Philippines had been  split into two (2) groups, one of which — composed mainly of young radicals,  constituting the Maoist faction — reorganized the Communist Party of the  Philippines early in 1969 and established a New People's Army. This faction adheres to the Maoist concept of  the 'Protracted People's War' or 'War of National Liberation.' Its 'Programme  for a People's Democratic Revolution' states, inter alia: 'The Communist Party of the Philippines is determined to implement its general programme for a people's democratic  revolution. All Filipino communists are  ready to sacrifice their lives for the worthy cause of achieving the new type  of democracy, of building a new Philippines that is genuinely and completely independent, democratic, united, just and  prosperous . . . 'The central task of any revolutionary movement is to seize  political power. The Communist Party of  the Philippines assumes this task at a time that both the international and national situation  are favorable, to taking the road of armed revolution . . .' 'In the year 1969, the NPA had — according to the records of the  Department of National Defense — conducted raids, resorted to kidnappings and  taken part in other violent incidents numbering over 230, in which it inflicted  404 casualties, and, in turn, suffered 243 losses. In 1970, its record of violent incidents was  about the same, but the NPA casualties more than doubled. 'At any rate, two (2) facts are undeniable: (a) all Communists, whether they belong to  the traditional group or to the Maoist faction, believe that force and violence  are indispensable to the attainment of their main and ultimate objective, and  act in accordance with such belief, although they disagree on the means to be  used at a given time and in a particular place; and (b) there is a New People's  Army, other, of course, than the Armed Forces of the Republic and antagonistic  thereto. Such New People's Army is per  se proof of the existence of a rebellion especially considering that its  establishment was announced publicly by the reorganized CPP. Such announcement is in the nature of a  public challenge to the duly constituted authorities and may be likened to a  declaration of war, sufficient to establish a war status or a condition of  belligerency, even before the actual commencement of hostilities. 'We entertain, therefore, no doubts about the existence of a  sizeable group of men who have publicly risen in arms to overthrow the  Government and have thus been and still are engage in rebellion against the  Government of the Philippines.' ""WHEREAS, these lawless elements have to a considerable extent  succeeded in impeding our duly constituted authorities from performing their functions  and discharging their duties and responsibilities in accordance with our laws  and our Constitution to the great damage, prejudice and detriment of the people  and the nation; ""WHEREAS, it is evident that there is throughout the land a  state of anarchy and lawlessness, chaos and disorder, turmoil and destruction  of a magnitude equivalent to an actual war between the forces of our duly  constituted Government and the New People's Army and their satellite  organizations because of the unmitigated forays, raids, ambuscades, assaults,  violence, murders, assassinations, acts of terror, deceits, coercions, threats,  intimidations, treachery, machinations, arsons, plunders and depredations  committed and being committed by the aforesaid lawless elements who have  pledged to the whole nation that they will not stop their dastardly effort and  scheme until and unless they have fully attained their primary and ultimate  purpose of forcibly seizing political and state power in this country by  overthrowing our present duly constituted Government, by destroying our  democratic way of life and our established secular and religious institutions  and beliefs, and by supplanting our existing political, social, economic, legal  and moral order with an entirely new one whose form of government, whose notion  of individual rights and family relations, and whose political, social,  economic and moral precepts are based on the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist teachings  and beliefs; ""WHEREAS, the Supreme Court in its said decision concluded  that the unlawful activities of the aforesaid lawless elements actually pose a  clear, present and grave danger to public safety and the security of the nation  and in support of that conclusion found that: '. . . the Executive had information and reports — subsequently  confirmed, in many respects, by the above-mentioned Report of the Senate Ad Hoc  Committee of Seven — to the effect that the Communist Party of the Philippines  does not merely adhere to Lenin's idea of a swift armed uprising; that it has,  also, adopted Ho Chi Minh's terrorist tactics and resorted to the assassination  of uncooperative local officials; that, in line with this policy, the  insurgents have killed 5 mayors, 20 barrio captains and 3 chiefs of police;  that there were fourteen (14) meaningful bombing incidents in the Greater  Manila Area in 1970; that the Constitutional Convention Hall was bombed on June  12, 1971, that, soon after the Plaza Miranda incident, the NAWASA main pipe at  the Quezon City-San Juan boundary, was bombed; that this was followed closely  by the bombing of the Manila City Hall, the COMELEC Building, the Congress  Building and the MERALCO sub-station at Cubao, Quezon City; and that the  respective residences of Senator Jose J. Roy and Congressman Eduardo Cojuangco  were, likewise, bombed, as were the MERALCO main office premises, along Ortigas  Avenue, and the Doctor's Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Building, in Caloocan City. '. . . the reorganized Communist Party of the Philippines has,  moreover, adopted Mao's concept of protracted people's war, aimed at the  paralyzation of the will to resist of the Government, of the political,  economic and intellectual leadership, and of the people themselves; that  conformably to such concept, the Party has placed special emphasis upon a most  extensive and intensive program of subversion by the establishment of front  organizations in urban centers, the organization of armed city partisans and  the infiltration in student groups, labor unions, and farmer and professional  groups; that the CPP has managed to infiltrate or establish and control nine  (9) major labor organizations; that it has exploited the youth movement and  succeeded in making Communist fronts of eleven (11) major student or youth  organizations; that there are, accordingly, about thirty (30) mass  organizations actively advancing the CPP interests, among which are the  Malayang Samahan ng Magsasaka (MASAKA), the Kabataang Makabayan (KM), the  Movement for the Advancement of Nationalism (MAN), the Samahang Demokratiko ng  Kabataan (SDK), the Samahang Molave (SM), and the Malayang Pagkakaisa ng  Kabataang Pilipino (MPKP); that, as of August, 1971, the KM had two hundred  forty-five (245) operational chapters throughout the Philippines of which  seventy-three were in the Greater Manila Area, sixty (60) in Northern Luzon,  forty-nine (49) in Central Luzon, forty-two (42) in the Visayas and twenty-one  (21) in Mindanao and Sulu; that in 1970, the Party had recorded two hundred  fifty-eight (258) major demonstrations, of which about thirty-three (33) ended  in violence, resulting in fifteen (15) killed and over five hundred (500)  injured; that most of these actions were organized, coordinated or led by the  aforementioned front organizations; that the violent demonstrations were  generally instigated by a small, but well-trained group of armed agitators;  that the number of demonstrations heretofore staged in 1971 has already  exceeded those of 1970; and that twenty-four (24) of these demonstrations were  violent, and resulted in the death of fifteen (15) persons and the injury of  many more. 'Subsequent events . . . have also proven . . . the threat to  public safety posed by the New People's Army. Indeed, it appears that, since August 21, 1971, it had in Northern Luzon  six (6) encounters and staged one (1) raid, in consequence of which seven (7)  soldiers lost their lives and two (2) others were wounded, whereas the  insurgents suffered five (5) casualties; that on August 26, 1971, a well-armed  group of NPA, trained by defector Lt. Victor Corpus, attacked the very command  post of TF LAWIN in Isabela, destroying two (2) helicopters and one (1) plane,  and wounding one (1) soldier; that the NPA had in Central Luzon a total of four  (4) encounters, with two (2) killed and three (3) wounded on the side of the  Government, one (1) BSDU killed and three (3) KM-SDK leader, an unidentified  dissident, and Commander Panchito leader of the dissident group were killed;  that on August 26, 1971, there was an encounter in the barrio of San Pedro,  Iriga City, Camarines Sur, between the PC and the NPA, in which a PC and two  (2) KM members were killed; that the current disturbances in Cotabato and the  Lanao provinces have been rendered more complex by the involvement of the  CPP/NPA, for, in mid-1971, a KM group, headed by Jovencio Esparagoza, contacted  the Higaonan tribes, in their settlement in Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental, and  offered them books, pamphlets and brochures of Mao Tse Tung, as well as  conducted teach-ins in the reservation; that Esparagoza was reportedly killed  on September 22, 1971, in an operation of the PC in said reservation; and that  there are now two (2) NPA cadres in Mindanao. 'It should, also be noted that adherents of the CPP and its front  organizations are, according to intelligence findings, definitely capable of  preparing powerful explosives out of locally available materials; that the bomb  used in the Constitutional Convention Hall was a 'Claymore' mine, a powerful  explosive device used by the U.S. Army, believed to have been one of many  pilfered from the Subic Naval Base a few days before; that the President had  received intelligence information to the effect that there was a July-August  Plan involving a wave of assassinations, kidnappings, terrorism and mass  destruction of property and that an extraordinary occurrence would signal the  beginning of said event; that the rather serious condition of peace and order  in Mindanao, particularly in Cotabato and Lanao, demanded the presence therein  of forces sufficient to cope with the situation; that a sizeable part of our  armed forces discharges other functions, and that the expansion of the CPP  activities from Central Luzon to other parts of the country, particularly  Manila and its suburbs, the Cagayan Valley, Ifugao, Zambales, Laguna, Quezon  and the Bicol Region, required that the rest of our armed forced be spread thin  over a wide area.' ""WHEREAS, in the unwavering prosecution of their revolutionary  war against the Filipino people and their duly constituted Government, the  aforesaid lawless elements have, in the months of May, June and July, 1972,  succeeded in bringing and introducing into the country at Digoyo Point,  Palanan, Isabela and at other undetermined points along the Pacific coastline  of Luzon, a substantial quantity of war material consisting of M-14 rifles  estimated to be some 3,500 pieces, several dozens of 40 mm rocket launchers  which are said to be Chicom copies of a Russian prototype rocket launcher,  large quantities of 80 mm rockets and ammunitions, and other combat  paraphernalia, of which war material some had been discovered and captured by  government military forces, and the bringing and introduction of such quantity  and type of war material into the country is a mute but eloquent proof of the  sinister plan of the aforesaid lawless elements to hasten the escalation of  their present revolutionary war against the Filipino people and their  legitimate Government; ""WHEREAS, in the execution of their overall revolutionary  plan, the aforesaid lawless elements have prepared and released to their  various field commanders and Party workers a document captioned 'REGIONAL  PROGRAM OF ACTION 1972,' a copy of which was captured by elements of the 116th  and 119th Philippine Constabulary Companies on June 18, 1972 at Barrio  Taringsing, Cordon, Isabela the text of which reads as follows: REGIONAL PROGRAM OF ACTION 1972 'The following Regional Program of Action 1972 is prepared to be  carried out as part of the overall plan of the party to foment discontent and  precipitate the tide of nationwide mass revolution. The fascist Marcos and his reactionary  members of Congress is expected to prepare themselves for the 1973 hence: 'January — June: '1. Intensify recruitment of new party members  especially from the workers-farmers class. Cadres are being trained in order to organize the different regional  bureaus. These bureaus must concentrate  on mass action and organization to promote advancement of the mass  revolutionary movement. Reference is made to the Borador ng Programa sa  Pagkilos at Ulat ng 'Panlipunang Pagsisiyasat' as approved by the Central  Committee. '2. Recruit and train armed city partisans and  urban guerrillas and organize them into units under Party cadres and activities  of mass organizations. These units must  undergo specialized training on explosives and demolition and other forms of  sabotage. '3. Intesify recruitment and training of new  members of the New People's Army in preparation for limited offensive in  selected areas in the regions. '4. Support a more aggressive program of  agitation and propaganda against the reactionary armed forces against the  Con-Con. 'July — August: 'During this period the Party expects the puppet Marcos government  to allow increase in bus rates thus aggravating further the plight of students,  workers and the farmers. '1. All Regional Party Committees must plan for a  general strike movement. The Regional  Operational Commands must plan for armed support if the fascist armed forces of  Marcos will try to intimidate the oppressed Filipino masses. '2. Conduct sabotage against schools, colleges  and universities hiking tuition fees. '3. Conduct sabotage and agitation against puppet  judges and courts hearing cases against top party leaders. '4. Create regional chaos and disorders to  dramatize the inability of the fascist Marcos Government to keep and maintain  peace and order thru: — 'a.) Robbery and hold-up of banks controlled by  American imperialists and those belonging to the enemies of the people. 'b) Attack military camps, US bases and towns. 'c) More violent strikes and demonstrations. 'September — October: 'Increase intensity of violence, disorder and confusion: '1.

Sporadic attacks on camps, towns and cities. '3. Assassinate high Government officials of  Congress, Judiciary, Con-Con and private individuals sympathetic to puppet  Marcos. '4. Establish provisional revolutionary  government in towns and cities with the support of the masses. '5. With the sympathetic support of our allies,  establish provisional provincial revolutionary governments. CENTRAL  COMMITTEE COMMUNIST PARTY OF  THE PHILIPPINES ""WHEREAS in line with their REGIONAL PROGRAM OF ACTION 1972,  the aforesaid lawless elements have of late been conducting intensified acts of  violence and terrorisms during the current year in the Greater Manila Area such  as the bombing of the Arca building at Taft Avenue, Pasay City, on March 15; of  the Filipinas Orient Airways board room at Domestic Road, Pasay City on April  23; of the Vietnamese Embassy on May 30; of the Court of Industrial Relations  on June 23; of the Philippine Trust Company branch office Cubao, Quezon City on  June 24; of the Philamlife building at United Nations Avenue, Manila, on July  3; of the Tabacalera Cigar & Cigarette Factory Compound at Marquez de  Comillas, Manila on July 27; of the PLDT exchange office at East Avenue, Quezon  City, and of the Philippine Sugar Institute building at North Avenue, Diliman,  Quezon City, both on August 15; of the Department of Social Welfare building  at San Rafael Street, Sampaloc, Manila,  on August 17; of a water main on Aurora Boulevard and Madison Avenue, Quezon  City on August 19; of the Philamlife building again on August 30; this time  causing severe destruction on the Far East Bank and Trust Company building  nearby; of the armored car and building of the Philippine Banking Corporation  as well as the buildings of the Investment Development Inc. and the Daily Star  Publications when another explosion took place on Railroad Street, Port Area,  Manila also on August 30; of Joe’s Department Store on Carriedo Street, Quiapo,  Manila, on September 5, causing death to one woman and injuries to some 38  individuals; and of the City Hall of Manila on September 8; of the watermains  in San Juan, Rizal on September 12, of the San Miguel Building in Makati, Rizal  on September 14; and of the Quezon City Hall on September 18, 1972, as well as  the attempted bombing of the Congress Building on July 18, when an unexploded  bomb was found in the Senate Publication Division and the attempted bombing of  the Department of Foreign Affairs on August 30; ""WHEREAS, in line with the same 'REGIONAL PROGRAM OF ACTION  1972,' the aforesaid lawless elements have also fielded in the Greater Manila  area several of their 'Sparrow Units' or 'Simbad Units' to undertake  liquidation missions against ranking government officials, military personnel and  prominent citizens and to further heighten the destructions and depredations  already inflicted by them upon our innocent people, all of which are being  deliberately done to sow terror, fear and chaos amongst our population and to  make the Government look so helpless and incapable of protecting the lives and  property of our people; ""WHEREAS, in addition to the above described social disorder,  there is also the equally serious disorder in Mindanao and Sulu resulting from  the unsettled conflict between certain elements of the Christian and Muslim  population of Mindanao and Sulu, between the Christian 'Ilagas' and the Muslim  'Barracudas,' and between our government troops, and certain lawless  organizations such as the Mindanao Independence Movement; ""WHEREAS, the Mindanao Independence Movement with the active  material and financial assistance of foreign political and economic interests,  is engaged in an open and unconcealed attempt to establish by violence and  force a separate and independent political state out of the islands of Mindanao  and Sulu which are historically, politically and by law parts of the  territories and within the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the Republic of the  Philippines; ""WHEREAS, because of the aforesaid disorder resulting from armed  clashes, killings, massacres, arsons, rapes, pillages, destruction of whole  villages and towns and the inevitable cessation of agricultural and industrial  operations, all of which have been brought about by the violence inflicted by  the Christians, the Muslims, the 'Ilagas,' the 'Barracudas,' and the Mindanao  Independence Movement against each other and against our government troops, a  great many parts of the Islands of Mindanao and Sulu are virtually now in a  state of actual war; ""WHEREAS, the violent disorder in Mindanao and Sulu has to  date resulted in the killing of over 1,000 civilians and about 2,000 armed  Muslims and Christians, not to mention the more than five hundred thousand of  injured, displaced and homeless persons as well as the great number of  casualties among our government troops, and the paralyzation of the economy of  Mindanao and Sulu; ""WHEREAS, because of the foregoing acts of armed insurrection,  wanton destruction of human lives and property, unabated and unrestrained  propaganda attacks against the Government and its institutions,  instrumentalities, agencies and officials, and the rapidly expanding ranks of  the aforesaid lawless elements, and because of the spreading lawlessness and  anarchy throughout the land, all of which have prevented the Government to  exercise its authority, extend to its citizenry the protection of its laws and  in general exercise its sovereignty over all of its territories, caused serious  demoralization among our people and have made the public apprehensive and  fearful, and finally because public order and safety and the security of this  nation demand that immediate, swift, decisive and effective action be taken to  protect and insure the peace, order and security of the country and its  population and to maintain the authority of the Government; ""WHEREAS, in cases of invasion, insurrection or rebellion or  imminent danger thereof, I, as President of the Philippines, have, under the  Constitution three courses of action open to me, namely: (a) call out the armed forces to suppress the  present lawless violence; (b) suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus to make the arrest and apprehension of these lawless elements easier  and more effective; or (c) place the Philippines or any part thereof under  martial law; ""WHEREAS, I have already utilized the first two courses of  action, first, by calling upon the armed forces to suppress the aforesaid  lawless violence, committing to that specific job almost 50% of the entire  armed forces of the country and creating several task forces for that purpose  such as Task Force Saranay, Task Force Palanan, Task Force Isarog, Task Force  Pagkakaisa and Task Force Lancaf, and, second, by suspending, the privilege of  the writ of habeas corpus on August 21, 1971 up to January 11, 1972, but  in spite of all that, both courses of action were found inadequate and  ineffective to contain, much less solve, the present rebellion and lawlessness  in the country as shown by the fact that: 1. The radical left has increased the  number and area of operation of its from organizations and has intensified the  recruitment and training of new adherents in the urban and rural areas  especially from among the youth; 2. The Kabataang Makabayan (KM), the  most militant and outspoken front organization of the radical left, has  increased the number of its chapters from 200 as of the end of 1970 to 317 as  of July 31, 1972 and its membership from 10,000 as of the end of 1970 to 13,000  as of the end of July, 1972, showing very clearly the rapid growth of the  communist movement in this country. 3. The Samahang Demokratiko ng  Kabataan (SDK), another militant and outspoken front organization of the  radical left, has also increased the number of its chapters from an  insignificant number at the end of 1970 to 159 as of the end of July, 1972 and  has now a membership of some 1,495 highly indoctrinated, intensely committed  and almost fanatically devoted individuals; 4. The New People's Army, the most  active and the most violent and ruthless military arm of the radical left, has  increased its total strength from an estimated 6,500 (composed of 560 regulars,  1,500 combat support and 4,400 service support) as of January 1, 1972 to about  7,900 (composed of 1,028 regulars, 1,800 combat support and 5,025 service  support) as of July 31, 1972, showing a marked increased in its regular troops  of over 100% in such a short period of six months; 5. The establishment of sanctuaries  for the insurgents in Isabela, in Zambales, in Camarines Sur, and in some parts  of Mindanao , a development heretofore unknown in  our campaign against subversion and insurgency in this country; 6. The disappearance and dropping out  of school of some 3,000 high school and college students and who are reported  to have joined with the insurgents for training in the handling of firearms and  explosives; 7. The bringing and introduction into  the country of substantial war material consisting of military hardware and  supplies through the MV Karagatan at Digoyo Point, Palanan, Isabela, and the  fact that many of these military hardware and supplies are now in the hands of  the insurgents and are being used against our Government troops; 8. The infiltration and control of  the media by persons who are sympathetic to the insurgents and — the consequent  intensification of their propaganda assault against the Government and the  military establishment of the Government; 9. The formation at the grass-root  level of 'political power organs,' heretofore unknown in the history of the  Communist movement in this country, composed of Barrio Organizing Committees  (BOCs) to mobilize the barrio people for active involvement in the revolution;  the Barrio Revolutionary Committees (BRCs) to act as 'local governments' in  barrios considered as CPP/NPA bailiwicks; the Workers Oganizing Committees  (WOCs) to organize workers from all sectors; the School Organizing Committees  (SOCs) to conduct agitation and propaganda activities and help in the expansion  of front groups among the studentry; and the Community Organizing Committees  (COCs) which operate in the urban areas in the same manner as the BOCs; ""WHEREAS, the rebellion and armed action undertaken by these  lawless elements of the communist and other armed aggrupations organized to  overthrow the Republic of the Philippines by armed violence and force have  assumed the magnitude of an actual state of war against our people and the  Republic of the Philippines; ""NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the  Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested upon me by Article VII, Section 10;  Paragraph (2) of the Constitution, do hereby place the entire Philippines as  defined in Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution under martial law and, in  my capacity as their Commander-in-Chief, do hereby command the Armed Forces of  the Philippines, to maintain law and order throughout the Philippines, prevent  or suppress all forms of lawless violence as well as any act of insurrection or  rebellion and to enforce obedience to all the laws and decrees, orders and  regulations promulgated by me personally or upon my direction. ""In addition, I do hereby order that all persons presently  detained, as well as all others who may hereafter be similarly detained for the  crimes of insurrection or rebellion, and all other crimes and offenses  committed in furtherance or on the occasion thereof, or incident thereto, or in  connection therewith, for crimes against national security and the law of  nations, crimes against public order, crimes involving usurpation of authority,  rank, title and improper use of names, uniforms and insignia, crimes committed  by public officers, and for such other crimes as will be enumerated in orders  that I shall subsequently promulgate, as well as crimes as a consequence of any  violation of any decree, order or regulation promulgated by me personally or  promulgated upon my direction shall be kept under detention until otherwise  ordered released by me or by my duly designated representative.

""Done in the City of Manila ,  this 21st day of September, in the year of Our Lord, nineteen hundred and  seventy-two. ""(SGD.)  FERDINAND E. MARCOS President Republic of the Philippines "" On September 22, 1972 at 9 o'clock in the evening, clearance  for the implementation of the proclamation was granted, and forthwith, the  following general order, among others, was issued: ""GENERAL  ORDER NO. 2 (ORDERING THE SECRETARY OF  NATIONAL DEFENSE TO ARREST THE PERSONS NAMED IN THE ATTACHED LIST, AS WELL AS OTHER  PERSONS WHO MAY HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES AND OFFENSES ENUMERATED IN THE ORDER). Pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081, dated September 21, 1972, and in  my capacity as Commander-in-Chief of all the Armed Forces of the Philippines  and for being active participants in the conspiracy to seize political and  state power in the country and to take over the Government by force, the extent  of which has now assumed the proportion of an actual war against our people and  their legitimate Government and in order to prevent them from further  committing acts that are inimical or injurious to our people, the Government  and our national interest, I hereby order you as Secretary of National Defense  to forthwith arrest or cause the arrest and take into your custody the individuals  named in the attached list and to hold them until otherwise so ordered by me or  by duly designated representative. Likewise, I do hereby order you to arrest or cause the arrest and  take into custody and to hold them until otherwise ordered released by me or by  my duly authorized representative, such persons as may have committed crimes  and offenses in furtherance or on the occasion of or incident to or in  connection with the crimes of insurrection or rebellion as well as persons who  have committed crimes against national security and the law of nations crimes  against the fundamental law of the state, crimes against public order, crimes  involving usurpation of authority, title improper use of name, uniform and  insignia including persons guilty of crimes as public officers, as well as  those persons who may have violated any decree or order promulgated by me  personally or promulgated upon my direction. Done in the City of Manila ,  this 22nd day of September, in the year of Our Lord, nineteen hundred and seventy-two. (SGD.)  FERDINAND E. MARCOS President REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES "" In the list referred to in this order were the names, among  others, of all the petitioners herein. Thus, from shortly after midnight of September 22, 1972 until they were  all apprehended, petitioners were taken one by one, either from their homes or  places of work, by officers and men of the Armed Forces of the Philippines,  without the usual warrant of arrest, and only upon orders of the Respondent  Secretary of National Defense directed to his co-respondent, the Chief of Staff  of the Armed Forces. They have been  since then confined either at Camp Bonifacio . Camp Crame or some other military camp,  until, as earlier adverted to, they were released subject to certain  conditions, with the exception of petitioners Diokno and Aquino, who are still  in custody up to the present. The particular case of petitioner  Aquino As regards petitioner Aquino, it appears from his allegations in  his petition and supplemental petition for prohibition in G. R. No. L-37364,  already referred to earlier, (1) that on August 11, 1973, six criminal charges,  for illegal possession of firearms, etc., murder and violation of RA 1700 or  the Anti-Subersion Act, were filed against him with Military Commission No. 2, created  under General Order Nos. 8, 12 and 39, (2) that on August 28, 1973, the  President created, thru Administrative Order No. 355, a special committee to  undertake the preliminary investigation or reinvestigation of said charges, and  (3) that he questions the legality of his prosecution in a military commission  instead of in a regular civilian court as well as the creation of the special  committee, not only because of alleged invalidity of Proclamation 1081 and  General Order No. 2 and the orders authorizing the creation of military  commissions but also because Administrative Order No. 355 constitutes allegedly  a denial of the equal protection of the laws to him and to the others affected  thereby. From the procedural standpoint, these developments did not warrant  the filing of a separate petition. A  supplemental petition in G. R. No. L-35546, wherein he is one of the  petitioners, would have sufficed. But  inasmuch as petitioner Aquino has chosen to file an independent special civil  action for prohibition in said G.R. No. L-37364 without withdrawing his  petition for habeas corpus in G. R. No. L-35546, We wish to make it  clear that in this decision, the Court is going to resolve, for purposes of the habeas corpus petition of said petitioner, only the issues he has raised  that are common with those of the rest of the petitioners in all these cases,  thereby leaving for resolution in G.R. No. L-37364 all the issues that are  peculiar only to him. In other words,  insofar as petitioner Aquino is concerned, the Court will resolve in this  decision the question of legality of his detention by virtue of Proclamation  1081 and General Order No. 2, such that in G. R. No. L-37364, what will be  resolved will be only the constitutional issues related to the filing of charges  against him with Military Commission No. 2, premised already on whatever will  be the Court's resolution in the instant cases regarding Proclamation 1081 and  General Order No. 2. With respect to the other petitioners, none of them stands  charged with any offense before any court or military commission. In fact, they all contend that they have not  committed any act for which they can be held criminally liable. Going back to the facts, it may be mentioned, at this juncture,  that on the day Proclamation 1081 was signed, the Congress of the Philippines was actually holding a special session scheduled to end on September 22, 1972 . It had been in uninterrupted session since  its regular opening in January, 1972. Its regular session was adjourned on May 18, 1972, followed by three  special sessions of thirty days each, 8 from May 19 to June 22, June 23 to  July 27 and July 28 to August 31, and one special session of twenty days, from  September 1 to September 22. As a matter  of fact, petitioner Aquino was in a conference of a joint committee of the  Senate and the House of Representatives when he was arrested in one of the  rooms of the Hilton Hotel in Manila . It must also be stilted at this point that on November 30, 1972,  the Constitutional Convention of 1971, which convened on June 1, 1971 and had  been in continuous session since then, approved a New Constitution; that on  January 17, 1973, Proclamation 1102 was issued proclaiming the ratification  thereof; and that in the Ratification Cases aforementioned, the Supreme Court  rendered on March 31, 1973, a judgment holding that ""there is no further  judicial obstacle to the New Constitution being considered in force and  effect."" Among the pertinent provisions of the New Constitution is Section  3 (2) of Article XVII which reads thus: ""(2) All proclamations, orders, decrees,  instructions, and acts promulgated, issued or done by the incumbent President  shall be part of the law of the land, and shall remain valid, legal, binding,  and effective even after lifting of martial law or the ratification of this  Constitution, unless modified, revoked, superseded by subsequent proclamations,  orders, decrees, instructions, or other acts of the incumbent President, or  unless expressly and explicitly modified or repealed by the regular National  Assembly."" Before closing this narration of facts, it is relevant to state  that relative to petitioner Diokno's motion to withdraw, respondents filed  under dated of May 13, 1974 the following Manifestation: ""COME NOW respondents, by the undersigned counsel, and to this  Honorable Court respectfully submit this manifestation: 1. In a Motion dated December 29, 1973 petitioner,  through counsel, prayed for the withdrawal of the above-entitled case more  particularly the pleadings tiled therein. Respondents' Comments dated January   17, 1974 , petitioners' Reply dated March 7, 1974 , and respondents' Rejoinder dated March 27, 1974 were subsequently  submitted to this Honorable Court; 2. The motion to withdraw has been  used for propaganda purposes against the Government, including the Supreme  Court. Lately, the propaganda has been  intensified and the detention of petitioner and the pendency of his case in  this Court have been exploited; 3. We are aware that the issues  raised in this case are of the utmost gravity and delicacy. This is the reason we said that the decision  in these cases should be postponed until the emergency, which called for the  proclamation of martial law, is over. While this position is amply supported by precedents and is based on  sound policy consideration, we now feel that to protect the integrity of  government Institutions, including this Court, from scurrilous propaganda now  being waged with relentlessness, it would be in the greater interest of the  Nation to have the motion to withdraw resolved and if denied, to have the  petition itself decided; 4. This is not to say that the  emergency is over, but only to express a judgment that in view of recent  tactics employed in the propaganda against the Government, it is preferable in the  national interest to have the issues stirred by this litigation settled in this  forum. For, indeed, we must state and  reiterate that: a. Pursuant to the Presidents'  constitutional powers, functions, and responsibilities in a state of martial  law, he periodically requires to be conducted a continuing assessment of the  factual situation which necessitated the promulgation of Proclamation No. 1081  on September 21, 1972 and the continuation of martial law through Proclamation  No. 1104, dated January 17, 1973; b. The Government's current and  latest assessment of the situation, including evidence of the subversive  activities of various groups and individuals, indicates that there are still  pockets of actual armed insurrection and rebellion in certain parts of the country. While in the major areas of the active  rebellion the military challenge to the Republic and its duly constituted  Government has been overcome and effective steps have been and are being taken  to redress the centuries-old and deep-seated causes upon which the fires of  insurrection and rebellion have fed, the essential process of rehabilitation  and renascence is a slow and delicate process. On the basis of said current assessment and of consultations with the people,  the President believes that the exigencies of the situation, the continued  threat to peace, order, and security, the danger to stable government and to  democratic processes and institutions, the requirements of public safety, and  the actual imminent danger of insurrection and rebellion all require the  continuation of the exercise of powers incident to martial law; c. The majority of persons who had to  be detained upon the proclamation of martial law have been released and are now  engaged in their normal pursuits. However, the President has deemed that, considering the overall  situation described above and in view of adequate evidence which can not now be  declassified, the continued detention of certain individuals without the filing  of formal charges in court for subversive and other criminal acts is necessary  in the interest of national security and defense to enable the Government to  successfully meet the grave threats of rebellion and insurrection. In this regard, the Secretary of National  Defense and his authorized representatives have acted in accordance with  guidelines relating to national security which the President has prescribed. Respectfully submitted. Manila , Philippines , May 13, 1974 .""

MARCOS President Republic of the Philippines "" and the holding of a referendum on July 27-28, 1973 which as evidenced  by the COMELEC proclamation of August   3, 1973 resulted in the following: ""Under the present constitution the President, if he so  desires, can continue in office beyond 1973. Do you want President Marcos to continue beyond 1973 and finish the  reforms he has initiated under Martial Law? 18,052,016 - YES 1,856,744 - NO"" (Phil. Daily Express, August 4, 1973) THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES First of all, petitioners challenge the factual premises and  constitutional sufficiency of Proclamation 1081. Invoking the Constitution of 1935 under which  it was issued, they vigorously maintain that ""while there may be rebellion  in some remote places, as in Isabela, there is no basis for the nationwide  imposition of martial law, since: (a) no  large scale rebellion or insurrection exists in the Philippines; (b) public  safety does not require it, inasmuch as no department of the civil government —  is shown to have been unable to open or function because of or due to, the  activities of the lawless elements described in the Proclamation; (c) the  Executive has given the nation to understand — and there exists no evidence to  the contrary — that the armed forces can handle the situation without  'utilizing the extraordinary powers of the President etc;' and (d) problem in  the Greater Manila Area . . . where petitioners were seized and arrested was, a  the time martial law was proclaimed, plain lawlessness and criminality.""  (pp. 69-70, Petitioners' Memorandum). In  his supplemental petition, petitioner Diokno individually posits that  especially these days, with the improved conditions of peace and order, there  is no more constitutional justification for the continuance of martial  law. In other words, petitioners  question not only the constitutional sufficiency both in fact and in law of the  proclamation but also the legality of their detention and constraints,  independently of any finding of validity of the proclamation, while in his  supplemental petition petitioner Diokno individually submits that the Court  should declare that it has already become illegal to continue the present  martial law regime because the emergency for which it was proclaimed, if it  ever existed, has already ceased, as  attested by various public and official declarations of no less than the  President himself. On the other hand,  respondents would want the Court to lay its hands off the instant petitions,  claiming that under General Orders Nos. 3 and 3-A, aforequoted, the President  has ordered that the Judiciary shall not try and decide cases ""involving  the validity, legality or constitutionality"" of Proclamation 1081 and any  order, decree or acts issued or done pursuant to said Proclamation. They contend most vehemently that this Court  has no jurisdiction to inquire into the factual bases of the proclamation, any  question as to the propriety or constitutional sufficiency of its issuance  being, according to them, political and nonjusticiable. They point out, in this connection, that in  the above-mentioned referendum of January 10-15, 1973 and more so in that of  July 27-28, 1973; the sovereign people impressed their seal of approval on the  continuation of martial law for as long as the President may deem it wise to  maintain the same. And on the assumption  the Court can make an inquiry into the factual bases of the Proclamation, they  claim there was more than sufficient justification for its issuance, in the  light of the criterion of arbitrariness sanctioned by Us in Lansang vs .  Garcia, 42 SCRA 448. Respondents further  maintain that it is only by another official proclamation by the President, not  by a judicial declaration, that martial law may be lifted. Additionally, in their answer of July 26,  1973 to petitioner Diokno's supplemental petition, respondents contend that the  express provisions of the above-quoted transitory provision of the New  Constitution, have made indubitable that Proclamation 1081 as well as all the  impugned General Orders are constitutional and valid. Thus, the fundamental questions presented for the Court's  resolution are: 1. Does the Supreme Court have  jurisdiction to resolve the merits of the instant petitions? Put differently, are not the issues herein  related to the propriety or constitutional sufficiency of the issuance of the  Proclamation purely political, which are not for the judiciary, but for the  people and the political departments of the government to determine? And viewed from existing jurisprudence in the Philippines ,  is not the doctrine laid down by this Court in Lansang vs . Garcia,  supra, applicable to these cases? 2. Even assuming Lansang to be applicable,  and on the basis of the criterion of arbitrariness sanctioned therein, can it  be said that the President acted arbitrarily, capriciously or whimsically in  issuing Proclamation 1081? 3. Even assuming also that said  proclamation was constitutionally issued, may not the Supreme Court declare  upon the facts of record and those judicially known to it now that the  necessity for martial law originally found by the President to exist has  already ceased so us to make further continuance of the present martial law  regime unconstitutional? 4. Even assuming again that the  placing of the country under martial law is constitutional until the President  himself declares otherwise, is there any legal justification for the arrest and  detention as well as the other constraints upon the individual liberties of the  petitioners, and, in the affirmative, does such justification continue up to  the present, almost two years from the time of their apprehension, there being  no criminal charges of any kind against them nor any warrants of arrest for  their apprehension duly issued pursuant to the procedure prescribed by law? 5. Finally, can there still be any  doubt regarding the constitutionality of the issuance of Proclamation 1081 and  all the other proclamations and orders, decrees, instructions and acts of the  President issued or done by him pursuant to said Proclamation, considering that  by the terms of Section 3 (2) of Article XVII of the Constitution of the  Philippines of 1973, ""all proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions and  acts promulgated, issued or done by the incumbent President shall be part of  the law of the land, and shall remain valid, legal, binding and effective""  until revoked or superseded by the incumbent President himself or by the  regular National Assembly established under the same Constitution? I THE ISSUE OF JURISDICTION By its very nature, the issue of jurisdiction vigorously urged by  the Solicitor General calls for prior resolution. Indeed, whenever the authority of the Court to  act is seriously challenged, it should not proceed any further until that  authority is clearly established. And it  goes without saying that such authority may be found only in the existing laws  and/or the Constitution. For a moment, however, there was a feeling among some members of  the Court that the import of the transitory provisions of the New Constitution  referred to in the fifth question above has made the issue of jurisdiction  posed by the respondents of secondary importance, if not entirely academic. Until, upon further reflection, a consensus  emerged that for Us to declare that the transitory provision invoked has  rendered moot and academic any controversy as to the legality of the impugned  acts of the President is to assume that the issue is justiciable, thereby by  passing the very issue of jurisdiction We are asked to resolve. We feel that while perhaps, such reliance on  the transitory provision referred to may legally suffice to dispose of the  cases at bar, it cannot answer persistent queries regarding the powers of the  Supreme Court in a martial law situation. It would still leave unsettled a host of controversies related to the  continued exercise of extraordinary powers by the President. Withal, such assumption of justiciability  would leave the Court open to successive petitions asking that martial law be  lifted, without Our having resolved first the correctness of such  assumption. Indeed, nothing short of a  categorical and definite ruling of this Court is imperative regarding the  pretended non-justiciability of the issues herein, if the people are to know,  as they must, whether the present governmental order has legitimate  constitutional foundations or it is supported by nothing more than naked force  and self-created stilts to keep it above the murky waters of  unconstitutionality. Thus, it is but  proper that We tackle first the questions about the authority of the Court to  entertain and decide these cases before discussing the materiality and effects  of the transitory provision relied upon by respondents. As a matter of fact, it is not alone the matter of jurisdiction  that We should decide. Beyond the purely  legal issues placed before Us by the parties, more fundamental problems are  involved in these proceedings. There are  all-important matters which a historical decision like this cannot ignore on  the pretext that Our duty in the premises is exclusively judicial. Whether all the members of the Court like it  or not, the Court has to play its indispensable and decisive role in resolving  the problems confronting our people in the critical circumstances in which they  find themselves. After all, we cannot  dissociate ourselves from them, for we are Filipinos who must share the common  fate to which the denouement of the current situation will consign our  nation. The priority issue before Us is  whether We will subject the assailed acts of the President to judicial scrutiny  as to its factual bases or We will defer to his findings predicated on evidence  which are in the very nature of things officially available only to him, but in  either case, our people must know that Our decision has democratic foundations  and conforms with the great principles for which our nation exists. The New Constitution itself is in a large sense a product of the  political convulsion now shaking precariously the unity of the nation. Upon the other hand, that those presently in  authority had a hand in one way or another in its formulation, approval and  ratification can hardly be denied. To  justify, therefore, the restraint upon the liberties of petitioners through an  exclusive reliance on the mandates of the new charter, albeit logically and  technically tenable, may not suffice to keep our people united in the faith  that there is genuine democracy in the existing order and that the rule of law  still prevails in our land. Somehow the  disturbing thought may keep lingering with some, if not with many, of our  countrymen that by predicating Our decision on the basis alone of what the New  Constitution ordains, We are in effect allowing those presently in authority  the dubious privilege of legalizing their acts and exculpating themselves from  their supposed constitutional transgressions through a device which might yet  have been of their own furtive making. Besides, We should not be as naive as to ignore that in troublous  times like the present, simplistic solutions, however solidly based, of  constitutional controversies likely to have grave political consequences would  not sound cogent enough unless they ring in complete harmony with the tune set  by the founders of our nation when they solemnly consecrated it to the ideology  they considered best conducive to the contentment and prosperity of all our  people. And the commitment of the Philippines to the ideals of democracy and freedom is ever evident and indubitable. It is writ in the martyrdom of our  revolutionary forbears when they violently overthrew the yoke of Spanish  despotism. It is an indelible part of  the history of our passionate and zealous observance of democratic principles  and practices during the more than four decades that America was with us. It is reaffirmed in bright  crimson in the blood and the lives of the countless Filipinos who fought and  died in order that our country may not be subjugated under the militarism and  totalitarianism of the Japanese then, who were even enticing us with the idea  of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. And today, that our people are showing considerable disposition to  suffer the imposition of martial law can only be explained by their belief that  it is the last recourse to save themselves from the inroads of ideologies  antithetic to those they cherish and uphold. Withal, the eyes of all the peoples of the world on both sides of  the bamboo and iron curtains are focused and what has been happening in our  country since September 21, 1972 . Martial law in any country has such awesome  implications that any nation under it is naturally an interesting study subject  for the rest of mankind. Those who  consider themselves to be our ideological allies must be keeping apprehensive  watch on how steadfastly we shall remain living and cherishing our common  fundamental political tenets and ways of life, whereas those of the opposite  ideology must be eagerly anticipating how soon we will join them in the  conviction that, after all, real progress and development cannot be achieved  without giving up individual freedom and liberty and unless there is  concentration of power in the exercise of government authority. It is true the Philippines continues to enjoy  recognition of all the states with whom it had diplomatic relations before  martial law was proclaimed, but it is not difficult to imagine that as soon as  it has become definite or anyway apparent to those concerned that the  Philippines has ceased to adhere to the immutable concepts of freedom and  democracy enshrined in its own fundamental law, corresponding reactions would  manifest themselves in the treatment that will be given us by these states. In our chosen form of government, the Supreme Court is the  department that most authoritatively speaks the language of the  Constitution. Hence, how the present  martial law and the constraints upon the liberties of petitioners can be  justified under our Constitution which provides for a republican democratic  government will be read by the whole world in the considerations of this  decision. From them they will know  whither we are going as a nation. More  importantly, by the same token, history and the future generations of Filipinos  will render their own judgment on all of us who by the will of Divine  Providence have to play our respective roles in this epochal chapter of our  national life. By this decision,  everyone concerned will determine how truly or otherwise, the Philippines of  today is keeping faith with the fundamental precepts of democracy and liberty  to which the nation has been irrevocably committed by our heroes and martyrs  since its birth. And we should not gloss over the fact that petitioners have come  to this Court for the protection of their rights under the provisions of the  Old Charter that have remained unaltered by the New Constitution. It would not be fair to them, if the  provisions invoked by them still mean what they had always meant before, to  determine the fate of their petitions on the basis merely of a transitory  provision whose consistency with democratic principles they vigorously  challenge. In this delicate period of our national life, when faith in each  other and unity among all of the component elements of our people are indispensable,  We cannot treat the attitude and feelings of the petitioners, especially  Senator Diokno * who is still  under detention without formal charges, with apathy and indifferent  unconcern. Their pleadings evince quite  distinctly an apprehensive, nay a fast dwindling faith in the capacity of this  Court to render them justice. Bluntly  put, their pose is that the justice they seek may be found only in the correct  construction of the 1935 Constitution, and they make no secret of their fears  that because the incumbent members of the Court have taken an oath to defend  and protect the New Constitution, their hopes of due protection under the Bill  of Rights of the Old Charter may fall on deaf ears. Petitioner Diokno, in particular, with the  undisguised concurrence of his chief counsel, former Senator Tañada  despairingly bewails that although they are ""convinced beyond any nagging  doubt that (they are) on the side of right and reason and law and justice,  (they are) equally convinced that (they) cannot reasonably expect either right  or reason, law or justice, to prevail in (these) case(s)."" To be sure, We do not feel bound to soothe the subjective  despondency nor to cool down the infuriated feelings of litigants and lawyers  by means other than the sheer objectiveness and demonstrated technical accuracy  of our decisions. Under the peculiar  milieu of these cases, however, it is perhaps best that We do not spare any  effort to make everyone see that in discharging the grave responsibility  incumbent upon Us in the best light that God has given Us to see it, We have  explored every angle the parties have indicated and that We have exhausted all  jurisprudential resources within our command before arriving at our conclusions  and rendering our verdict. In a way, it  could indeed be part of the nobility that should never be lost in any court of  justice that no party before it is left sulking with the thought that he lost  because not all his important arguments in which he sincerely believes have  been duly considered or weighed in the balance. But, of course, petitioners' emotional misgivings are manifestly  baseless. It is too evident for anyone  to ignore that the provisions of the Old Constitution petitioners are invoking  remain unaltered in the New Constitution and that when it comes to the basic  precepts underlying the main portions of both fundamental laws, there is no  disparity, much less any antagonism between them, for in truth, they are the  same identical tenets to which our country, our government and our people have always  been ineradicably committed. Insofar,  therefore, as said provisions and their underlying principles are concerned,  the new oath taken by the members of the Court must be understood, not in the  disturbing sense petitioners take them, but rather as a continuing guarantee of  the Justices' unswerving fealty and steadfast adherence to the self-same tenets  and ideals of democracy and liberty embodied in the oaths of loyalty they took  with reference to the 1935 Constitution. Contrary to what is obviously the erroneous impression of  petitioner Diokno, the fundamental reason that impelled the members of the  Court to take the new oaths that are causing him unwarranted agony was  precisely to regain their independence from the Executive, inasmuch as the  transitory provisions of the 1973 Constitution had, as a matter of course,  subjected the judiciary to the usual rules attendant in the reorganization of  governments under a new charter. Under  Sections 9 and 10 of Article XVII, ""incumbent members of the Judiciary may  continue in office until they reach the age of seventy years, unless sooner  replaced"" by the President, but ""all officials whose appointments are  by this Constitution vested in the (President) shall vacate their offices upon  the appointment and qualification of their successors."" In other words,  under said provisions, the Justices ceased to be permanent. And that is precisely why our new oaths  containing the phrase ""na pinagpapatuloy sa panunungkulan"", which  petitioner Diokno uncharitably ridicules ignoring its real import, was prepared  by the Secretary of Justice in consultation with the Court, and not by the  President or any other subordinate in the Executive office, purposely to make  sure that the oath taking ceremony which was to be presided by the President  himself would connote and signify that thereby, in fact and in contemplation of  law, the President has already exercised the power conferred upon him by the  aforequoted transitory constitutional provisions to replace anyone of us with a  successor at anytime. There was no Presidential edict at all for the Justices to take  such an oath. The President informed the  Court that he was determined to restore the permanence of the respective  tenures of its members, but there was a feeling that to extend new appointments  to them as successors to themselves would sound somehow absurd. And so, in a conference among the President,  the Secretary of Justice and all the Justices, a mutually acceptable  construction of the pertinent transitory provision was adopted to the effect  that an official public announcement was to be made that the incumbent Justices  would be continued in their respective offices without any new appointment, but  they would take a fittingly worded oath the text of which was to be prepared in  consultation between the Secretary of Justice and the Court. Thus, by that oath taking, all the members of  the Court, other than the Chief Justice and the three new Associate Justices,  who because of their new appointments are not affected by the transitory  provisions, are now equally permanent with them in their constitutional  tenures, as officially and publicly announced by the President himself on that  occasion. Otherwise stated, the  reorganization of the Supreme Court contemplated in the transitory provisions  referred to, which, incidentally was also a feature of the transitory  provisions of the 1935 Constitution, albeit, limited then expressly to one  year, (Section 4, Article XVI) has already been accomplished, and all the  Justices are now unreachably beyond the presidential prerogative either  explicit or implicit in the terms of the new transitory provisions. It is, therefore, in these faith and spirit and with this  understanding, supported with prayers for guidance of Divine Providence, that  We have deliberated and voted on the issues in these cases — certainly, without  any claim of monopoly of wisdom and patriotism and of loyalty to all that is  sacred to the Philippines and the Filipino people. II As already stated, the Governments insistent posture that the  Supreme Court should abstain from inquiring into the constitutional sufficiency  of Proclamation 1081 is predicated on two fundamental grounds, namely, (1) that  under General Order No. 3, as amended by General Order No. 3-A, ""the  Judiciary (which includes the Supreme Court) shall continue to function in  accordance with its present organization and personnel, and shall try and  decide in accordance with existing laws all criminal and civil cases, except  the following: 1. Those involving the  validity, legality or constitutionality of Proclamation 1081 dated September  21, 1972 or of any decree, order or acts issued, promulgated or performed by  (the President) or by (his) duly designated representative pursuant  thereto,"" and (2) the questions involved in these cases are political and  non-justiciable and, therefore, outside the domain of judicial inquiry. A GENERAL ORDERS NOS. 3 AND 3-A  HAVE CEASED TO BE OPERATIVE INSOFAR AS THEY ENJOIN THE JUDICIARY OF  JURISDICTION OVER CASES INVOLVING THE VALIDITY OF THE PROCLAMATIONS, ORDERS OR  ACTS OF THE PRESIDENT. Anent the first ground thus invoked by the respondents, it is not  without importance to note that the Solicitor General relies barely on the  provisions of the general orders cited without elaborating as to how the  Supreme Court can be bound thereby. Considering that the totality of the judicial power is vested in the  Court by no less than the Constitution, both the Old and the New, the absence  of any independent showing of how the President may by his own fiat  constitutionally declare or order otherwise is certainly significant. It may be that the Solicitor General  considered it more prudent to tone down any possible frontal clash with the  Court, but as We see it, the simplistic tenor of the Solicitor General's  defense must be due to the fact too well known to require any evidential proof  that by the President's own acts, publicized here and abroad, he had made it  plainly understood that General Orders Nos. 3 and 3-A are no longer operative  insofar as they were intended to divest the Judiciary of jurisdiction to pass  on the validity, legality or constitutionality of his acts under the aegis of  martial law. In fact, according to the  President, it was upon his instructions given as early as September 24, 1972 , soon after the filing of the  present petitions, that the Solicitor General submitted his return and answer  to the writs We have issued herein. It  is a matter of public knowledge that the President's repeated avowal of the  Government's submission to the Court is being proudly acclaimed as the  distinctive characteristic of the so-called ""martial law — Philippine  style"", since such attitude endows it with the democratic flavor so  dismally absent in the martial law prevailing in other countries of the world. Accordingly, even if it were to be assumed at this juncture that  by virtue of the transitory provision of the New Constitution making all orders  of the incumbent President part of the law of the land, General Orders Nos. 3  and 3-A are valid, the position of the respondents on the present issue of  jurisdiction based on said orders has been rendered untenable by the very acts  of the President, which in the words of the same transitory provision have  ""modified, revoked or superseded"" them. And in this connection, it is important to  note that the transitory provision just referred to textually says that the  acts of the incumbent President shall ""remain valid, legal, binding and  effective . . . unless modified, revoked or superseded by subsequent proclamations,  orders, decrees, instructions or other acts of the incumbent President, or  unless expressly and explicitly modified or repealed by the regular National  Assembly"", thereby implying that the modificatory or revocatory acts of  the President need not be as express and explicit as in the case of the  National Assembly. In other words, when  it comes to acts of the President, mere demonstrated inconsistency of his  posterior acts with earlier ones would be enough for implied modification or  revocation to be effective, even if no statement is made by him to such effect. Rationalizing his attitude in regard to the Supreme Court during  martial law, President Marcos has the following to say in his book entitled  ""Notes on the New Society of the Philippines "": ""Our martial law is unique in that it is based on the  supremacy of the civilian authority over the military and on complete  submission to the decision of the Supreme Court, and most important of all, the  people. . . ."" (p. 103) * * * ""Thus, upon the approval by the Constitutional Convention of a  new Constitution, I organized the barangays or village councils or citizens  assemblies in the barrios (a barrio is the smallest political unit in the Philippines ). I directed the new Constitution to be  submitted to the barangays or citizens assemblies in a formal plebiscite from January 10 to 15, 1973 . The barangays voted almost unanimously to  ratify the Constitution, continue with martial law and with the reforms of the  New Society. This action was questioned in a petition filed before our Supreme  Court in the cases entitled Javellana vs . Executive Secretary et al,  G.R. No. L-36143, 36164, 36165, 36236 and 36283. The issue raised was whether I had the power  to call a plebiscite; whether I could proclaim the ratification of the new  Constitution. In raising this issue, the  petitioners (who, incidentally, were Liberals or political opposition leaders)  raised the fundamental issue of the power of the President under a proclamation  of martial law to issue decrees. Inasmuch as the issues in turn raised the question of the  legitimacy of the entire Government and also to meet the insistent suggestion  that, in the event of an adverse decision, I proclaim a revolutionary  government, I decided to submit to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as I  had done in the Lansang vs . Garcia case (already quoted) in 1971 when  almost the same parties in interest questioned my powers as President to  suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus . (Refer to pp. 13-17.) This would, at the same time, calm the fears of every cynic who had  any misgivings about my intentions and claimed that I was ready to set up a  dictatorship. For who is the dictator  who would submit himself to a higher body like the Supreme Court on the question  of the constitutionality or validity of his actions?"" (pp. 103-104.) * * * ""It will be noted that I had submitted myself to the  jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in all cases questioning my authority in 1971  in the case of Lansang vs . Garcia on the question of the suspension of  the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , and in the case just cited  on the proclamation of martial law as well as the other related cases.""  (pp. 105-106.) Nothing could be more indicative, than  these words of the President himself, of his resolute intent to render General  Orders Nos. 3 and 3-A inoperative insofar as the Supreme Court's jurisdiction  over cases involving the validity, legality or constitutionality of his acts  are concerned. Actually, the tenor and  purpose of the said general orders are standard in martial law proclamations,  and the President's attitude is more of an exception to the general  practice. Be that as it may, with this  development, petitioners have no reason to charge that there is a  ""disrobing"" of the Supreme Court. But even as the President unequivocally reaffirms, over and above  martial law, his respect for the Supreme Court's constitutionally assigned role  as the guardian of the Constitution and as the final authority as to its  correct interpretation and construction, it is entirely up to the Court to  determine and define its own constitutional prerogatives vis-a-vis the  Proclamation and the existing martial law situation, given the reasons for the  declaration and its avowed objectives. B MAY THE SUPREME COURT INQUIRE  INTO THE FACTUAL BASES OF THE ISSUANCE OF PROCLAMATION 1081 TO DETERMINE ITS  CONSTITUTIONAL SUFFICIENCY? The second ground vigorously urged by the Solicitor General is  more fundamental, since, prescinding from the force of the general orders just  discussed, it strikes at the very core of the judicial power vested in the  Court by the people thru the Constitution. It is claimed that insofar as the instant petitions impugn the issuance  of Proclamation 1081 as having been issued by the President in excess of his  constitutional authority, they raise a political question not subject to  inquiry by the courts. And with  reference to the plea of the petitioners that their arrest, detention and other  restraints, without any charges or warrants duly issued by the proper judge,  constitute clear violations of their rights guaranteed by the fundamental law,  the stand of the respondents is that the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus has been suspended automatically in consequence of the imposition of  martial law, the propriety of which is left by the Constitution to the  exclusive discretion of the President, such that for the proper exercise of  that discretion he is accountable only to the sovereign people, either directly  at the polls or thru their representatives by impeachment. Never before has the Supreme Court of the Philippines been confronted with a problem of such transcendental consequences and  implications as the present one entails. There is here an exertion of extreme state power involving the  proclaimed assumption of the totality of government authority by the Executive,  predicated on his own declaration that a state of rebellion assuming ""the  magnitude of an actual state of war against our people and the Republic of the  Philippines"" exists (22nd whereas of Proclamation 1081) and that ""the  public order and safety and the security of this nation demand that immediate,  swift, decisive and effective action be taken to protect and insure the peace,  order and security of the country and its population and to maintain the  authority of the government."" (19th whereas, id.) Upon the other hand,  petitioners deny the factual bases of the Proclamation and insist that it is  incumbent upon the Court, in the name of democracy, liberty and the Constitution,  to inquire into the veracity thereof and to declare, upon finding them to be  untrue, that the Proclamation is unconstitutional and void. Respondents counter, however, that the very  nature of the Proclamation demands that the Court should refrain from making  any such inquiry, considering that, as already stated, the discretion as to  whether or not martial law should be imposed is lodged by the Constitution in  the President exclusively. As We enter upon the extremely delicate task of resolving the  grave issues thus thrust upon Us, We are immediately encountered by absolute  verities to guide Us all the way. The  first and most important of them is that the Constitution 9 is  the supreme law of the land. This means  among other things that all the powers of the government and of all its  officials from the President down to the lowest emanate from it. None of them may exercise any power unless it  can be traced thereto either textually or by natural and logical implication. The second is that is settled that the Judiciary provisions of  the Constitution point to the Supreme Court as  the ultimate arbiter of all conflicts as to what the Constitution or any part  thereof means. While the other  Departments may adopt their own construction thereof, when such construction is  challenged by the proper party in an appropriate case wherein a decision would  be impossible without determining the correct construction, the Supreme Court's  word on the matter controls. The third is that in the same way that the Supreme Court is the  designated guardian of the Constitution, the President is the specifically  assigned protector of the safety, tranquility and territorial integrity of the  nation. This responsibility of the  President is his alone and may not be shared by any other Department. The fourth is that, to the end just stated, the Constitution  expressly provides that ""in case of invasion, insurrection or rebellion or  imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, he (the Executive)  — ""may (as a last resort) . . . place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law"". 10 The fifth is that in the same manner that the Executive power  conferred upon the Executive by the Constitution is complete, total and  unlimited, so also, the judicial power vested in the Supreme Court and the  inferior courts, is the very whole of that power, without any limitation or  qualification. The sixth is that although the Bill of Rights in the Constitution  strictly ordains that ""no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or  property without due process of law"", 11 even this basic guarantee of  protection readily reveals that the Constitution's concern for individual  rights and liberties is not entirely above that for the national interests,  since the deprivation it enjoins is only that which is without due process of  law, and laws are always enacted in the national interest or to promote and  safeguard the general welfare. Of  course, it is understood that the law thus passed, whether procedural or substantive,  must afford the party concerned the basic elements of justice, such as the  right to be heard, confrontation, and counsel, inter alia . And the seventh is that whereas the Bill of Rights of the 1935  Constitution explicity enjoins that ""(T)he privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion, insurrection, or  rebellion, when the public safety requires it, in any of which events the same  may be suspended wherever during such period the necessity for such suspension  shall exist"", 12 there is no similar injunction  whether expressed or implied against the declaration of martial law. From these incontrovertible postulates, it results, first of all,  that the main question before Us is not in reality one of jurisdiction, for  there can be no conceivable controversy, especially one involving a conflict as  to the correct construction of the Constitution, that is not contemplated to be  within the judicial authority of the courts to hear and decide. The judicial power of the courts being  unlimited and unqualified, it extends over all situations that call for the  ascertainment and protection of the rights of any party allegedly violated,  even when the alleged violator is the highest official of the land or the  government itself. It is, therefore,  evident that the Court's jurisdiction to take cognizance of and to decide the  instant petitions on their merits is beyond challenge. In this connection, however, it must be borne in mind that in the  form of government envisaged by the framers of the Constitution and adopted by  our people, the Court's indisputable and plenary authority to decide does not  necessarily impose upon it the duty to interpose its fiat as the only means of  settling the conflicting claims of the parties before it. It is ingrained in the distribution of powers  in the fundamental law that hand in hand with the vesting of the judicial power  upon the Court, the Constitution has coevally conferred upon it the discretion  to determine, in consideration of the constitutional prerogatives granted to  the other Departments, when to refrain from imposing judicial solutions and  instead defer to the judgment of the latter. It is in the very nature of republican governments that certain matters  are left in the residual power of the people themselves to resolve, either  directly at the polls or thru their elected representatives in the political  Departments of the government. And these  reserved matters are easily distinguishable by their very nature, when one  studiously considers the basic functions and responsibilities entrusted by the  charter to each of the great Departments of the government. To cite an obvious example, the protection,  defense and preservation of the state against internal or external aggression  threatening its very existence is far from being within the ambit of judicial  responsibility. The distinct role then  of the Supreme Court of being the final arbiter in the determination of  constitutional controversies does not have to be asserted in such contemplated  situations, thereby to give way to the ultimate prerogative of the people  articulated thru suffrage or thru the acts of their political representatives  they have elected for the purpose. Indeed, these fundamental considerations are the ones that lie at  the base of what is known in American constitutional law as the political  question doctrine, which in that jurisdiction is unquestionably deemed to be  part and parcel of the rule of law, exactly like its apparently more attractive  or popular opposite, judicial activism, which is the fullest exertion of  judicial power, upon the theory that unless the courts intervene injustice  might prevail. It has been invoked and  applied by this Court in varied forms and modes of projection in several  momentous instances in the past; 13 and it is the main support of the  stand of the Solicitor General on the issue of jurisdiction in the cases at  bar. It is also referred to as the  doctrine of judicial self-restraint or abstention. But as the nomenclatures themselves imply,  activism and self-restraint are both subjective attitudes, not inherent  imperatives. The choice of alternatives  in any particular eventuality is naturally dictated by what in the Court's  considered opinion is what the Constitution envisions should be done in order  to accomplish the objectives of government and of nationhood. And perhaps it may be added here to avoid  confusion of concepts, that We are not losing sight of the traditional approach  based on the doctrine of separation of powers. In truth, We perceive that even under such mode of rationalization, the  existence of power is secondary, respect for the acts of a co-ordinate,  co-equal and co-independent Department being the general rule, particularly  when the issue is not encroachment of delimited areas of functions but alleged  abuse of a Department's own basic prerogatives. In the final analysis, therefore, We need not indulge in any  further discussion as to whether or not the Court has jurisdiction over the  merits of the instant petitions. It is  definite that it has. Rather, the real  question before Us is whether or not the Court should act on them. Stated differently, do We have here that  appropriate occasion for activism on the part of the Court, or, do the  imperatives of the situation demand, in the light of the reservations in the fundamental  law just discussed, that We defer to the political decision of the  Executive? After mature deliberation,  and taking all relevant circumstances into account, We are convinced that the  Court should abstain in regard to what is in all probability the most important  issue raised in them, namely, whether or not the Court should inquire into the  constitutional sufficiency of Proclamation 1081 by receiving evidence tending  to belie the factual premises thereof. It is Our considered view that under the  Constitution, the discretion to determine ultimately whether or not the  Philippines or any part thereof should be placed under martial law and for how  long is lodged exclusively in the Executive, and for this reason, it is best  that We defer to his judgment as regards the existence of the grounds therefor,  since, after all, it is not expected that the Supreme Court should share with  him the delicate constitutional responsibility of defending the safety,  security, tranquility and territorial integrity of the nation in the face of a  rebellion or invasion. This is not  abdication of judicial power, much less a violation of Our oaths ""to  support and defend the Constitution""; rather, this is deference to an act  of the Executive which, in Our well-considered view, the Constitution  contemplates the Court should refrain from reviewing or interfering with. To Our mind, the following considerations, inter  alia , impel no other conclusion: 1 It has been said that martial law has no generally accepted  definition, much less a precise meaning. But as We see it, no matter how variously it has been described, a  common element is plainly recognizable in whatever has been said about it — it  does not involve executive power alone. To be more exact, martial law is state power which involves the totality  of government authority, irrespective of the Department or official by whom it  is administered. This is because, as  admitted by all, martial law is every government's substitute for the established  governmental machinery rendered inoperative by the emergency that brings it  forth, in order to maintain whatever legal and social order is possible during  the period of emergency, while the government is engaged in battle with the  enemy. Otherwise, with the breakdown of  the regular government authority or the inability of the usual offices and  officials to perform their functions without endangering the safety of all  concerned, anarchy and chaos are bound to prevail and protection of life and  property would be nil. What is worse,  the confusion and disorder would detract the defense efforts. It is indispensable therefore that some kind  of government must go on, and martial law appears to be the logical  alternative. Hence, from the point of  view of safeguarding the people against possible governmental abuses, it is not  the declaration of martial law and who actually administers it that is of  supreme importance. Someone has of  necessity to be in command as surrogate of the whole embattled government. It is what is actually done by the administrator  affecting individual rights and liberties that must pass constitutional  standards, even as these are correspondingly adjusted to suit the necessities  of the situation. But this is not to say  that redress of constitutional offenses would immediately and necessarily be  available, for even the procedure for securing redress, its form and time must  depend on what such necessities will permit. Viewed in depth, this is all that can be visualized as contemplated in  the supposedly fundamental principle invoked by petitioners to the effect that  necessity and necessity alone is the justification and the measure of the  powers that may be exercised under martial law. 2 In countries where there is no constitutional provision  sanctioning the imposition of martial law, the power to declare or proclaim the  same is nevertheless conceded to be the most vital inherent prerogative of the  state because it is axiomatic that the right of the state to defend itself  against disintegration or subjugation by another cannot be less than an  individual's natural right of self-defense. The resulting repression or restraint of individual rights is therefore  justified as the natural contribution that the individual owes to the state, so  that the government under which he lives may survive. After all, such subordination to the general  interest is supposed to be temporary, coincident only with the requirements of  the emergency. At the same time, under the general practice in those countries,  it is considered as nothing but logical that the declaration or proclamation  should be made by the Executive. So it  is that none of the cases cited by petitioners, including those of Hearon vs .  Calus, 183, S.E. 24 and Allen vs . Oklahoma City, 52 Pac. Rep. 2nd  Series, pp. 1054-1059, may be deemed as a binding precedent sustaining  definitely that it is in the power of the courts to declare an Executive's  proclamation or declaration of martial law in case of rebellion or insurrection  to be unconstitutional and unauthorized. Our own research has not yielded any jurisprudence upholding the  contention of petitioners on this point. What is clear and incontrovertible from all the cases cited by both  parties is that the power of the Executive to proclaim martial law in case of  rebellion has never been challenged, not to say outlawed. It has always been assumed, even if the  extent of the authority that may be exercised under it has been subjected to  the applicable provision of the constitution, with some courts holding that the  enforceability of the fundamental law within the area of the martial law regime  is unqualified, and the others maintaining that such enforceability must be  commensurate with the demands of the emergency situation. In other words, there is actually no  authoritative jurisprudential rule for Us to follow in respect to the specific  question of whether or not the Executive's determination of the necessity to  impose martial law during a rebellion is reviewable by the judiciary. If We have to go via the precedential route,  the most that We can find is that the legality of an Executive's exercise of  the power to proclaim martial law has never been passed upon by any court in a  categorical manner so as to leave no room for doubt or speculation. 3 In the Philippines . We do not have to resort to assumptions  regarding any inherent power of the government to proclaim a state of martial  law. What is an implied inherent  prerogative of the government in other countries is explicitly conferred by our  people to the government in unequivocal terms in the fundamental law. More importantly in this connection, it is to  the Executive that the authority is specifically granted ""in cases of  invasion, insurrection or rebellion, when public safety requires it"", to  ""place the Philippines or any part thereof under Martial Law"". To be sure, petitioners admit that much. But they insist on trying to show that the factual premises of the  Proclamation are not entirely true and are, in any event, constitutionally  insufficient. They urge the Court to  pass on the merits of this particular proposition of fact and of law in their  petitions and to order thereafter the nullification and setting aside thereof. We do not believe the Court should interfere. The pertinent constitutional provision is explicit and unequivocal. It reads as follows: ""(2) The President shall be commander-in-chief of  all armed forces of the Philippines and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to  prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or  rebellion. In case of invasion,  insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety  requires it, he may suspend the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus ,  or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law."" (Section 10(2), Article VII, 1935  Constitution.) ""SEC. 12. The Prime  Minister shall be commander-in-chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to  prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or  rebellion. In case of invasion,  insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety  requires it, he may suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus ,  or place the Philippines of any part thereof under martial law."" (Section 12, Article IX, 1973  Constitution.) Except for the reference to the Prime Minister in the New  Constitution instead of to the President as in the Old, the wording of the  provision has remained unaltered ipssissimis verbis. Accordingly, the two Constitutions cannot  vary in meaning; they should be construed and applied in the light of exactly  the same considerations. In this sense  at least, petitioners' invocation of the 1935 Constitution has not been  rendered academic by the enforcement of the new charter. For the purposes of these cases, We will in  the main consider their arguments as if there has been no Javellana decision. Now, since in those countries where martial law is an  extra-constitutional concept, the Executive's proclamation thereof, as observed  above, has never been considered as offensive to the fundamental law, whether  written or unwritten, and, in fact, not even challenged, what reason can there  be that here in the Philippines, wherein the Constitution directly and definitely  commits the power to the Executive, another rule should obtain? Are we Filipinos so incapable of electing an  Executive we can trust not to unceremoniously cast aside his constitutionally  worded oath solemnly and emphatically imposing upon him the duty ""to  defend and protect the Constitution""? Or is the Court to be persuaded by possible partisan prejudice or the  subjective rationalization informing personal ambitions? Reserving for further discussion the effect of Lansang upon the  compelling force of the opinions in Barcelon vs . Baker, 5 Phil. 87 and  Montenegro vs . Castaneda, 91 Phil. 862, relative to the issue at hand,  We cannot lightly disregard the ponderous reasons discussed in said opinions  supporting the view that the Executive's choice of means in dealing with a  rebellion should be conclusive. In  Barcelon, this Court said: ""Thus the question is squarely presented whether or not the  judicial department of the Government may investigate the facts upon which the  legislative and executive branches of the Government acted in providing for the  suspension and in actually suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus in said provinces. Has the  Governor-General, with the consent of the Commission, the right to suspend the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus ? If so, did the Governor-General suspend the writ of habeas corpus in the Provinces of Cavite and Batangas in accordance with such authority? A paragraph of section 5 of the act of Congress of July 1, 1902 , provides: 'That the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not  be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the  public safety may require it, in either of which events the same may be  suspended by the President, or by the Governor-General with the approval of the  Philippine Commission, whenever during such period the necessity for such  suspension shall exist.' This provision of the act of Congress is the only provision giving  the Governor-General and the Philippine Commission authority to suspend the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus . No question has been raised with reference to the authority of Congress  to confer this authority upon the President or the Governor-General of these Islands ,  with the approval of the Philippine Commission. This provision of the act of Congress makes two conditions  necessary in order that the President or the Governor-General with the approval  of the Philippine Commission may suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus. They are as follows: (1) When there exists rebellion, insurrection, or  invasion; and (2) When public safety may require it. In other words, in order that the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus may be suspended, there must exist rebellion, insurrection, or  invasion, and the public safety must require it. This fact is admitted, but the question is,  Who shall determine whether there exists a state of rebellion, insurrection, or  invasion, and that by reason thereof the public safety requires the suspension  of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus ? It has been argued and admitted that the Governor-General, with the  approval of the Philippine Commission, has discretion, when insurrection,  rebellion, or invasion actually exist, to decide whether the public safety  requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus ;  but the fact whether insurrection, rebellion, or invasion does actually exist  is an open question, which the judicial department of the Government may  inquire into and that the conclusions of the legislative and executive  departments (the Philippine Commission and the Governor-General) of the  Government are not conclusive upon that question. In other words, it is contended that the judicial department of the  Government may consider an application for the writ of habeas corpus ,  even though the privileges of the same have been suspended, in the manner  provided by law, for the purposes of taking proof upon the question whether  there actually exists a state of insurrection, rebellion, or invasion. The applicants here admit that if a state of rebellion,  insurrection, or invasion exists, and the public safety is in danger, then the  President, or Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine Commission,  may suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus . Inasmuch as the President, or Governor-General with the approval of  the Philippine Commission, can suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus only under the conditions mentioned in the said statute, it becomes  their duty to make an investigation of the existing conditions in the  Archipelago, or any part thereof, to ascertain whether there actually exists a  state of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion, and that the public safety  requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus . When this investigation is concluded, the  President, or the Governor-General with the consent of the Philippine  Commission, declares that there exist these conditions, and that the public  safety requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can the judicial department of the Government investigate the same facts and  declare that no such conditions exist? The act of Congress, above quoted, wisely provides for the  investigation by two departments of the Government — the legislative and  executive — of the existing conditions, and joint action by the two before the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in these Islands . If the investigation and findings of the President, or the  Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine Commission, are not  conclusive and final as against the judicial department of the Government, then  every officer whose duty it is to maintain order and protect the lives and  property of the people may refuse to act, and apply to the judicial department of  the Government for another investigation and conclusion concerning the same  conditions, to the end that they may be protected against civil actions  resulting from illegal acts. Owing to conditions at times, a state of insurrection, rebellion,  or invasion may arise suddenly and may jeopardize the very existence of the  State. Suppose, for example, that one of  the thickly populated Governments situated near this Archipelago, anxious to  extend its power and territory, should suddenly decide to invade these Islands ,  and should, without warning, appear in one of the remote harbors with a  powerful fleet and at once begin to land troops. The governor or military commander of the  particular district or province notifies the Governor-General by telegraph of  this landing of troops and that the people of the district are in collusion  with such invasion. Might not the  Governor-General and the Commission accept this telegram as sufficient evidence  and proof of the facts communicated and at once take steps, even to the extent  of suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , as might  appear to them to be necessary to repel such invasion? It seems that all men interested in the  maintenance and stability of the Government would answer this question in the  affirmative. But suppose someone, who has been arrested in the district upon the  ground that his detention would assist in restoring order and in repelling the  invasion, applies for the writ of habeas corpus , alleging that no  invasion actually exists; may the judicial department of the Government call  the officers actually engaged in the field before it and away from their posts  of duty for the purpose of explaining and furnishing proof to it concerning the  existence or non-existence of the facts proclaimed to exist by the legislative  and executive branches of the State? If  so, then the courts may effectually tie the hands of the executive, whose  special duty it is to enforce the laws and maintain order, until the invaders have  actually accomplished their purpose. The  interpretation contended for here by the applicants, so pregnant with  detrimental results, could not have been intended by the Congress of the United    States when it enacted the law. It is the duty of the legislative branch of the Government to make such  laws and regulations as will effectually conserve peace and good order and  protect the lives and property of the citizens of the State. It is the duty of the Governor-General to  take such steps as he deems wise and necessary for the purpose of enforcing  such laws. Every delay and hindrance and  obstacle which prevents a strict enforcement of laws under the conditions  mentioned necessarily tends to jeopardize public interests and the safety of  the whole people. If the judicial  department of the Government, or any officer in the Government, has a right to  contest the orders of the President or of the Governor-General under the  conditions above supposed, before complying with such orders, then the hands of  the President or the Governor-General may be tied until the very object of the  rebels or insurrectos or invaders has been accomplished. But it is urged that the President, or the  Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine Commission, might be  mistaken as to the actual conditions; that the legislative department — the  Philippine Commission — might, by resolution, declare after investigation, that  a state of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion exists, and that the public  safety requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus ,  when, as a matter of fact, no such conditions actually existed; that the  President, or Governor-General acting upon the authority of the Philippine  Commission, might by proclamation suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus without there actually existing the conditions mentioned in the act  of Congress. In other words, the  applicants allege in their argument in support of their application for the  writ of habeas corpus , that the legislative and executive branches of  the Government might reach a wrong conclusion from their investigations of the  actual conditions, or might, through a desire to oppress and harass the people,  declare that a state of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion existed and that  public safety required the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus when actually and in fact no such conditions did exist. We can not assume that the legislative and  executive branches will act or take any action based upon such motives. Moreover it can not be assumed that the legislative and executive  branches of the Government, with all the machinery which those branches have at  their command for examining into the conditions in any part of the Archipelago,  will fail to obtain all existing information concerning actual conditions. It is the duty of the executive branch of the  Government to constantly inform the legislative branch of the Government of the  condition of the Union as to the prevalence of peace or  disorder. The executive branch of the  Government, through its numerous branches of the civil and military, ramifies  every portion of the Archipelago, and is enabled thereby to obtain information  from every quarter and corner of the State. Can the judicial department of the Government, with its very limited  machinery for the purpose of investigating general conditions, be any more sure  of ascertaining the true conditions throughout the Archipelago, or in any  particular district, than the other branches of the Government? We think not."" (At p. 91-96.) * * * ""The same general question presented here was presented to the  Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Martin vs . Mott, in January, 1821. An act of Congress of 1795 provided — 'That whenever the United States shall be invaded or be in imminent  danger of invasion from any foreign nation or Indian tribe, it shall be lawful  for the President of the United States to call forth such number of the militia  of the State or States most convenient to the place of danger or scene of  action, as he may judge necessary to repel such invasion, and to issue his  orders for that purpose to such officer or officers of the militia as he shall  think proper.' In this case (Martin vs . Mott) the question was presented to  the court whether or not the President's action in calling out the militia was  conclusive against the courts. The  Supreme Court of the United States ,  in answering this question, said: 'The power thus confided by Congress to the President is,  doubtless, of a very high and delicate nature. A free people are naturally jealous of the exercise of military power;  and the power to call the militia into actual service is certainly felt to be  one of no ordinary magnitude. But it is  not a power which can be executed without corresponding responsibility. It is, in its terms, a limited power,  confined to cases of actual invasion, or of imminent danger of invasion. If it be a limited power, the question  arises, By whom is the exigency to be adjudged of and decided? Is the President the sole and exclusive judge  whether the exigency has arisen, or is it to be considered as an open question,  upon which every officer to whom the orders of the President are addressed, may  decide for himself, and equally open to be contested by every militiaman who  shall refuse to obey the orders of the President? We are all of the opinion that the authority  to decide whether the exigency has arisen belongs exclusively to the President  and his decision is conclusive upon all other persons. We think that this construction necessarily  results from the nature of the power itself and from the manifest object  contemplated by the act of Congress. The  power itself is to be exercised upon sudden emergencies, upon great occasions  of state and under circumstances which may be vital to the existence of the Union .  . . . If a superior officer has a right  to contest the orders of the President, upon his own doubts as to the exigency  having arisen, it must be equally the right of every inferior officer and  soldier . . . Such a course would be  subversive of all discipline and expose the best disposed officer to the  chances of erroneous litigation. Besides, in many instances, the evidence upon which the President might  decide that there is imminent danger of invasion might be of a nature not  constituting strict technical proof, or the disclosure of the evidence might  reveal important secrets of state which the public interest and even safety  might imperiously demand to be kept in concealment. 'Whenever the statute gives a discretionary power to any person, to  be exercised by him upon his own opinion of certain facts, it is a sound rule  of construction that the statute constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge  of the existence of those facts. And in  the present case we are all of opinion, that such is the true construction of  the act of 1795. It is no answer that  such power may be abused, for there is no power which is not susceptible of  abuse.' (Martin vs . Mott, 12 Wheat., 19 (25 U.S); Vanderheyden vs .  Young, 11 Johns., N.Y., 150.) Justice Joseph Story, for many years a member of the Supreme Court  of the United States ,  in discussing the question who may suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus , under the Constitution of the United    States , said: 'It would seem, as the power is given to Congress to suspend the  writ of habeas corpus in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion,  that the right to judge whether the exigency has arisen must conclusively  belong to that body.' (Story on the Constitution, 5th ed., sec. 1342.) Justice James Ket, for many years a justice of the supreme court of  the State of New York, in discussing the same question, cites the case of  Martin vs . Mott, and says: 'In that case it was decided and settled by the Supreme Court of  the United States that it belonged exclusively to the President to judge when  the exigency arises in which he had authority, under the Constitution, to call  forth the militia, and that his decision was conclusive upon all other persons.'  (Kent's Commentaries, 14th ed., vol. 1, bottom p. 323.) John Randolph Tucker, for many years a professor of constitutional  and international law in Washington and Lee University ,  in discussing this question, said: 'By an act passed in 1795 Congress gave to the President power to  call out the militia for certain purposes, and by subsequent acts, in 1807,  power was given to him to be exercised whenever he should deem it necessary,  for the purposes stated in the Constitution; and the Supreme Court (United  States) has decided that this executive discretion in making the call (for  State militia) could not be judicially questioned.' (Tucker on the  Constitution, Vol. II, p. 581.) John Norton Pomeroy, an eminent law writer upon constitutional  questions said: 'In Martin vs . Mott it was decided that under the authority  given to the President by the statute of 1795, calling forth the militia under  certain circumstances, the power is exclusively vested in him to determine  whether those circumstances exist; and when he has determined by issuing his  call, no court can question his decision.' (Pomeroy's Constitutional Law, sec.  476.) Henry Campbell Black, a well-known writer on the Constitution,  says: 'By an early act of Congress it was provided that in case of an insurrection  in any State against the government thereof it shall be lawful for the  President of the United States, on application of the legislature of such  State, or of the executive (when the legislature can not be convened), to call  forth such a number of the militia of any other State or States as may be  applied for, as he may judge sufficient to suppress such insurrection. By this act the power of deciding whether the  exigency has arisen upon which the Government of the United    States is bound to interfere is given to the  President.' (Black's Constitutional Law, p. 102.) Judge Thomas M. Cooley, in discussing the right of the judicial  department of the Government to interfere with the discretionary action of the  other departments of the Government, in his work on constitutional law, said: 'Congress may confer upon the President the power to call them (the  militia) forth, and this makes him the exclusive judge whether the exigency has  arisen for the exercise of the authority and renders one who refuses to obey  the call liable to punishment under military law.' (Cooley's Principles of  Constitutional Law, p. 100.) But it may be argued by those who contend for the contrary  doctrine, to wit, that the acts of the Governor-General, with the approval of  the Philippine Commission, are not conclusive upon the courts and that none of  the foregoing citations are exactly in point, that none of these cases or  authors treat of a case exactly like the one presented. We are fortunate, however, in being able to  cite, in answer to that contention, the case of Henry William Boyle, where  exactly the same question was presented to the supreme court of the State of Idaho ,  which the applicants present here and where the courts held the doctrine of the  cases applied. In the case of Boyle, he  had been arrested after the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus had been  suspended. He applied for a writ of habeas corpus to the supreme court of Idaho ,  alleging, among other things, in his application: First. That 'no insurrection, riot, or rebellion now exists in Shoshone County ;' and Second. That 'the Governor has no authority to proclaim martial law  or suspend the writ of habeas corpus .' In reply to this contention on the part of the applicant, Boyle,  the court said: 'Counsel have argued ably and ingeniously upon the question as to  whether the authority to suspend the writ of habeas corpus rests with  the legislative and executive powers of the Government, but, from our views of  this case, that question cuts no figure. We are of the opinion that whenever, for the purpose of putting down  insurrection or rebellion, the exigencies of the case demand it, with the  successful accomplishment of this end in view, it is entirely competent for the  executive or for the military officer in command, if there be such, either to  suspend the writ or disregard it if issued. The statutes of this State (Idaho) make it the duty of the governor,  whenever such a state or condition exists as the proclamation of the governor  shows does exist in Shoshone County, to proclaim such locality in a state of  insurrection and to call in the aid of the military of the State or of the  Federal Government to suppress such insurrection and reestablish permanently  the ascendancy of the law. It would be  an absurdity to say that the action of the executive, under such circumstances,  may be negative and set at naught by the judiciary or that the action of the  executive may be interfered with or impugned by the judiciary. If the courts are to be made a sanctuary, a  seat of refuge whereunto malefactors may fall for protection from punishment  justly due for the commission of crime they will soon cease to be that  palladium of the rights of the citizen so ably described by counsel. 'On application for a writ of habeas corpus , the truth of  recitals of alleged facts in a proclamation issued by the governor proclaiming  a certain county to be in a state of insurrection and rebellion will not be  inquired into or reviewed. The action of  the governor in declaring Shoshone County to be in state of insurrection and  rebellion, and his action in calling to his aid the military forces of the  United States for the purpose of restoring good order and the supremacy of the  law, has the effect to put in force, to a limited extent, martial law in said county. Such action is not in violation of the  Constitution, but in harmony with it, being necessary for the preservation of  government. In such case the Government  may, like an individual acting in self-defense, take those steps necessary to  preserve its existence. If hundreds of  men can assemble themselves and destroy property and kill and injure citizens,  thus defeating the ends of government, and the Government is unable to take all  lawful and necessary steps to restore law and maintain order, the State will  then be impotent if not entirely destroyed, and anarchy placed in its stead. 'It having been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the governor,  after some six or seven years of experience, that the execution of the laws in  Shoshone County through the ordinary and established means and methods was  rendered practicably impossible, it became his duty to adopt the means  prescribed by the statute for establishing in said county the supremacy of the  law and insuring the punishment of those by whose unlawful and criminal acts  such a condition of things has been brought about; and it is not the province  of the courts to interfere, delay, or place obstructions in the path of duty  prescribed by law for the executive, but rather to render him all the aid and  assistance in their power, in his efforts to bring about the consummation most  devoutly prayed for by every good, law-abiding citizen in the State.' (In re  Boyle, 45 L.R.A., 1899, 832.);.)"" (At pp. 99-104.) These observations are followed on pages  104 to 115 by a compilation of decided cases centrally holding that  ""whenever the Constitution or a statute gives a discretionary power to any  person, to be exercised by him upon his own opinion of certain facts, such  person is to be considered the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of  those facts."" For the sake of brevity, We shall not quote the discussion  anymore. We are confident there can be  no dissent insofar as the general proposition stated is concerned. Notably, in the unanimous decision of this Court in Montenegro ,  these views are totally adopted in a very brief passage thus: ""B. In his second  proposition appellant insists there is no state of invasion, insurrection,  rebellion or imminent danger thereof. 'There are' he admits 'intermittent sorties and lightning attacks by  organized bands in different places'; but, he argues, 'such sorties are  occasional, localized and transitory. And the proclamation speaks no more than of overt acts of insurrection  and rebellion, not of cases of invasion, insurrection or rebellion or imminent  danger thereof.' On this subject is noted that the President concluded from the  facts recited in the proclamation, and others connected therewith, that 'there  is actual danger of rebellion which may extend throughout the country.' Such  official declaration implying much more than imminent danger of rebellion amply  justifies the suspension of the writ. To the petitioner's unpracticed eye the repeated encounters between  dissident elements and military troops may seem sporadic, isolated, or  casual. But the officers charged with  the Nation's security, analyzed the extent and pattern of such violent clashes  and arrived at the conclusion that they are warp and woof of a general scheme  to overthrow this government vi et armis , by force and arms. And we agree with the Solicitor General that in the light of the  views of the United States Supreme Court thru Marshall, Taney and Story quoted  with approval in Barcelon vs . Baker (5 Phil., 87, pp. 98 and 100) the  authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen requiring suspension  belongs to the President and 'his decision is final and conclusive' upon the  courts and upon all other persons. Indeed as Justice Johnson said in that decision, whereas the  Executive branch of the Government is enabled thru its civil and military  branches to obtain information about peace and order from every quarter and  corner of the nation, the judicial department, with its very limited machinery  can not be in better position to ascertain or evaluate the conditions  prevailing in the Archipelago."" (At pp. 886-887.) There are actually many more judicial precedents and opinions of  knowledgeable and authoritative text writers, that can be copied here,  maintaining with inexorable logic why the Executive is incomparably best  equipped and prepared to cope with internal and external aggression and that,  indeed, the protection of the country against such contingencies is his sole  responsibility not supposed to be shared by the Judiciary. But the proposition appears to Us so plain  and ineluctable that to summon all of them to Our assistance could only open Us  to the suspicion that the Philippine Supreme Court has to depend on borrowed  thinking to resolve the most critical issues between individual rights, on the  one hand, and state power exerted as a matter of self-defense against rebellion  and subversion imperiling the country's own survival, on the other. Empathically, We don't have to. Thank God We have enough native genius and indigenous means and resources to cope with the most delicate problems of  statehood. Let others listen to and  abide by the platitudinous and elegantly phrased dicta in Milligan, supra,  Duncan and White, 14 they who are in and of the  wealthiest and mightiest power in the world, that only actual military combat  and related operations can justify martial law, but We, who are in and of a  small and weak developing nation, let us hearken and follow the home-spun  advice of our barrio folks cautioning everyone thus: ""Kung ang bahay mo ay pawid at  kawayan, pagdilim ng ulap at lumalakas na ang hangin, magsara ka na ng bintana  at suhayan mo and iyong bahay."" (When your house is made of nipa and  bamboo, and you see the clouds darkening and the winds start blowing, it is  time for you to close your windows and strengthen the support of your house.) This could explain why under the  Constitution, martial law can be declared not only in case of actual rebellion,  but even only when there is imminent danger thereof. And that is why the open court rule  established in Milligan and reiterated in Duncan and White is not controlling in this jurisdiction. Besides, inasmuch as our people have included in the Constitution  an express commitment of the power to the President, why do We have to resort  to the pronouncements of other courts of other countries wherein said power is  only implied? Regardless of what other  courts believe their Executive may do in emergencies, our task is not to  slavishly adopt what those courts have said, for there is no evidence that such  was the intent of our constitutional fathers. Rather, We should determine for Ourselves what is best for our own  circumstances in the Philippines ,  even if We have to give due consideration to the experience other peoples have  gone through under more or less similar crises in the past. In any event, regardless of their weight insofar as the  suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is concerned,  We consider the reasons given in the above-quoted opinions in Barcelon and Montenegro of particular relevance when it comes to the imposition of martial law. - 4 - It may be that the existence or non-existence or imminence of a  rebellion of the magnitude that would justify the imposition of martial law is  an objective fact capable of judicial notice, for a rebellion that is not of  general knowledge to the public cannot conceivably be dangerous to public  safety. But precisely because it is  capable of judicial notice, no inquiry is needed to determine the propriety of  the Executive's action. Again, while the existence of a rebellion may be widely known,  its real extent and the dangers it may actually pose to the public safety are  not always easily perceptible to the unpracticed eye. In the present day practices of rebellion,  its inseparable subversion aspect has proven to be more effective and important  than ""the rising (of persons) publicly and taking arms against the  Government"" by which the Revised Penal Code characterizes rebellion as a  crime under its sanction (Art. 134, Revised Penal Code). Subversion is such a covert kind of  anti-government activity that it is very difficult even for army intelligence  to determine its exact area of influence and effect, not to mention the details  of its forces and resources. By  subversion, the rebels can extend their field of action unnoticed even up to  the highest levels of the government, where no one can always be certain of the  political complexion of the man next to him, and this does not exclude the  courts. Arms, ammunitions and all kinds  of war equipment travel and are transferred in deep secrecy to strategic  locations, which can be one's neighborhood without him having any idea of what  is going on. There are so many insidious  ways in which subversives act, in fact too many to enumerate, but the point  that immediately suggests itself is that they are mostly incapable of being  proven in court, so how are We to make a judicial inquiry about them that can  satisfy our judicial conscience? The Constitution definitely commits it to the Executive to determine  the factual bases and to forthwith act as promptly as possible to meet the  emergencies of rebellion and invasion which may be crucial to the life of the  nation. He must do this with unwavering  conviction, or any hesitancy or indecision on his part will surely detract from  the needed precision in his choice of the means he would employ to repel the  aggression. The apprehension that his  decision might be held by the Supreme Court to be a transgression of the fundamental  law he has sworn to ""defend and preserve"" would deter him from acting  when precisely it is most urgent and critical that he should act, since the  enemy is about to strike the mortal blow. Different men can honestly and reasonably vary in assessing the  evidentiary value of the same circumstance, and the prospect of being  considered as a constitutional felon rather than a saviour of the country  should the Justices disagree with him, would put the Executive in an unenviable  predicament, certainly unwise and imprudent for any Constitution to contemplate  he should be in. But what is worse is  that the Court is not equipped in any way with the means to adequately  appreciate the insidious practices of subversion, not to say that it cannot do  it with more or at least equal accuracy as the Executive. Besides, the Court would then be acting  already with considerable hindsight considerations which can imperceptibly  influence its judgment in overriding the Executive's finding. More than ever before, when rebellion was purely a surface  action, and viewing the matter from all angles, it appears ineludible that the  Court should refrain from interfering with the Executive's delicate  decision. After all, the sacred rights  of individuals enshrined in the Bill of Rights and the other constitutional  processes ever valuable to the people, but which admittedly cannot, by the way,  be more important than the very survival of the nation, are not necessarily  swept away by a state of martial law, for, as already pointed out earlier, the  validity of the Proclamation is one thing, the administration of the government  under it is something else that has to be done with the closest adherence to  the fundamental law that the obvious necessities of the situation will  permit. As We see it, it is in this  sense that the Constitution is the supreme law equally in times of peace and of  war and for all classes of men, if We must refer again to petitioners' reliance  on Milligan. At the same time, let us  not overlook, in connection with this favorite authority of petitioners, that  the Federal Supreme Court's postulation therein, that it was ""happily  proved by the result of the great effort to throw off (the) just  authority"" of the United States during the Civil War that the constitution  of that country contains within itself all that is necessary for its  preservation, is not factually accurate, for all the world knows that if the  American Union survived the ordeal of possible disintegration and is the great  nation that she is today, it was not because President Lincoln confined himself  strictly to the powers vested in the presidency by the constitution, but  because he was wise enough to resort to inherent extra constitutional state  prerogatives, exercisable by the Executive alone, which President Marcos did  not have to do, considering that our Constitution expressly confers upon him  the authority to utilize such state power in defense of the nation. — 5 — The historical development of the powers of the Philippine  Executive unmistakably points to the same direction. Practically all the constitutions that came  into being during the revolutionary period before the turn of the last century,  of which the Malolos Constitution is typical, either entrusted executive power  to a commission or made the Executive largely dependent on the legislature. When the Americans ended their military  occupation, after subduing the Aguinaldo forces of independence, they had their  own version of governmental powers. In  the Philippine Bill of 1902, nothing was mentioned about martial law, and the  power of the Governor General to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus was conditioned on, among other things, the concurrence of the  Philippine Commission of which, notably, the Governor General was the  head. When in 1905, the Governor General  suspended the Privilege in the provinces of Cavite and Batangas, the case of Barcelon vs . Baker, supra, arose. Over the dissent of Justice Willard who  invoked Milligan, the Supreme Court held that the proclamation ordering such  suspension was not reviewable by the Judiciary. With a little touch of irony, in 1916, when the United States  Congress, with the avowed intent of granting greater political autonomy to the  Philippines, enacted the Jones Law, it removed the need for legislative  concurrence in regards to the suspension of the Privilege, because the  legislature was to be in Filipino hands, and in addition to preserving such  power of suspension, granted the Governor-General the sole authority to declare  martial law, subject only to revocation by the President of the United  States. Without forgetting that at that  time, the Governor-General being then an American, those powers served as  weapons of the colonizer to consolidate its hold on the subject people, such  plenitude of power in the Executive was to appear later to the Filipino leaders  as something that should be adopted in our fundamental law. So it was that in the Constitutional  Convention of 1934, the first the Philippines ever held in peace time, the  delegates, drawing heavily from the experience of the country during the  autonomous period of the Jones Law, and perchance persuaded in no small measure  by the personality of President Manuel L. Quezon, lost no time in adopting the  concept of a strong executive. Their decision  was studied and deliberate. Indeed, it  is the unanimous observation of all students of our Constitution, that under  it, we have in the Philippines the strongest executive in the world. Fully aware of this feature and appearing rather elated by the apparent  success of the delegates to reconcile the possible evils of dictatorship with  the need of an executive who ""will not only know how to govern, but will  actually govern"", President Claro M. Recto of the Convention remarked in  his valedictory address adjourning the Assembly as follows: ""During the debate on the Executive Power it was the almost  unanimous opinion that we had invested the Executive with rather extraordinary  prerogatives. There is much truth in  this assertion. But it is because we  cannot be insensible to the events that are transpiring around us, events  which, when all is said and done, are nothing but history repeating  itself. In fact, we have seen how  dictatorships, whether black or red, capitalistic or proletarian, fascistic or  communistic, ancient or modern, have served as the last refuge of peoples when  their parliaments fail and they are already powerless to save themselves from  misgovernment and chaos. Learning our  lesson from the truth of history, and determined to spare our people the evils  of dictatorship and anarchy, we have thought it prudent to establish an  executive power which, subject to the fiscalization of the Assembly, and of  public opinion, will not only know how to govern, but will actually govern,  with a firm and steady hand, unembarrassed by vexations, interferences by other  departments, or by unholy alliances with this and that social group. Thus, possessed with the necessary gifts of  honesty and competence, this Executive will be able to give his people an orderly  and progressive government, without need of usurping or abdicating powers, and  cunning subterfuges will not avail to extenuate his failures before the bar of  public opinion."" (""The Philippine Constitution — Sources, Making,  Meaning, and Application"" published by the Philippine Lawyers' Association,  p. 540.) Of particular relevance to the present discussion is the fact  that when an attempt was made by a few delegates led by Delegate Salvador  Araneta of Manila to subject the Executive's power to suspend the privilege of  the writ of habeas corpus to concurrence or review by the National  Assembly and the Supreme Court, the effort did not prosper, thereby strongly  indicating, if it did not make it indubitably definite, that the intent of the  framers of the fundamental law is that the Executive should be the sole judge  of the circumstances warranting the exercise of the power thus granted. In any event, the only evidence of any  thinking within the convention advocating the revocation of the Barcelon  doctrine of which together with Milligan, they were or ought to have been  aware, what with the best known lawyers in the Philippines in their midst,  collapsed with the rejection of the Araneta proposal. It was in the light of this historical development of the  Executive Power that in 1951, the Supreme Court decided unanimously the case of  Montenegro vs . Castañeda, supra, reiterating the doctrine of  conclusiveness of the Executive's findings in the Barcelon case. For all that it may be worthy of mention here, if only because  practically the same Filipino minds, led by President Jose P. Laurel, were  largely responsible for its formulation, the Constitution of the Second  Philippine Republic born under aegis of the Japanese occupation of the  Philippines during the Second World War, provided also for a strong executive. On this point, President Laurel himself had  the following to say: ""The fundamental reason and necessity for the creation of a  political center of gravity under the Republic is that, in any form of  government — and this is especially true in an emergency, in a national crisis  — there must be a man responsible for the security of the state, there must be  a man with adequate powers, to face any given situation and meet the problems  of the nation. There must be no shifting  of responsibility; there must be no evasion of responsibility; and if a  government is to be a real government and a scientific government there must be  no two centers of gravity but one. (2  O.G. [J.M.A.], 873 [1943].)"" (The Philippine Presidency by Irene R.  Cortes, p. 14.) The foregoing is a logical follow-up of what Laurel had said in the 1934 Convention thus: ""x x x A strong executive he is intended to be, because a  strong executive we shall need, especially in the early years of our  independent, or semi-independent existence. A weak executive is synonymous with a weak government. He shall not be a 'monarch' or a dictator in  time of profound and Octavian peace, but he virtually so becomes in an  extraordinary emergency ; and whatever may be his position, he bulwarks,  normally, the fortifications of a strong constitutional government, but  abnormally, in extreme cases, he is suddenly ushered in as a Minerva,  full-grown and in full panoply of war, to occupy the vantage ground as the  ready protector and defender of the life and honor of his nation."" (Italics  supplied.) (The Philippine Constitution, published by the Phil. Lawyers  Association, Vol. I, 1969 Ed., p. 183.) Thus, it is not surprising at all that without changing one word  in the provision granting to the Executive the power to cope with the  emergencies under discussion, the 1971 Convention fortified thru related  provisions in the transitory portion of the Constitution the applicability of  the Barcelon and Montenegro concepts of the Executive's power, as applied to  the imposition of martial law, thereby weakening pro tanto as will  be seen in the following pages, the impact of Our Lansang doctrine, for the  purposes of the precise issue now before Us. At this juncture, it may be pointed out that the power granted to  the Executive to place the country or any part thereof under martial law is  independent of the legislative grant to him of emergency powers authorized  under the following provision of the 1935 Constitution: ""Sec. 26. In times of  war or other national emergency, the Congress may by law authorize the  President, for a limited period and subject to such restrictions as it may  prescribe, to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out a declared national  policy."" (Art VI, sec. 26, 1935 Constitution.) This provision is copied verbatim in the 1973 Charter except for  the reference to the Prime Minister instead of to the President and the  addition of the following sentence indicating more emphatically the temporary  nature of the delegation: ""Unless sooner withdrawn by resolution of the National  Assembly, such powers shall cease upon its next adjournment."" (Section 15,  Article VIII, 1973 Constitution of the Philippines.) The point that immediately surges to the mind upon a reading of  this provision is that in times of war or other national emergency it is  definitely to the Executive that the people thru the fundamental law entrust  the running of the government, either by delegation of the legislative power to  him thru an express enactment of the Legislature to that effect or by direct  authorization from the Constitution itself to utilize all the powers of  government should he find it necessary to place the country or any part thereof  under martial law. Additional evidence  of such clear intent is the fact that in the course of the deliberations in the  Constitutional Convention of 1934 of the proposal to incorporate the above  provision in the charter, Delegate Wenceslao Vinzons of Camarines Norte moved  to delete the same for fear that the concentration of powers in one man may  facilitate the emergence of a dictatorship. He said in part: ""The power to promulgate rules and regulations in times of  emergency or war is not recognized in any constitution except, perhaps, the  Constitution of Denmark, which provides that in case of special urgency the  King may, when the Reichstag is not in session, issue laws of temporary  application. Such laws, however, shall not be contrary to the Constitution, and  they shall be submitted to the Reichstag in its next session. So, even in a kingdom like Denmark ,  the powers of the King are limited in times of emergency. ""Under the Constitution we are drafting now, there is  absolutely no limit except when the National Assembly specifies at the  inception of the grant of power. ""I want to warn, Mr. President, of a future condition in our  Republic when we shall no longer be under the tutelage of any foreign power,  when we shall have to work for our own destiny. I want to say that I am not very positive in stating here that we shall  have a dictatorship because the structure of the government that we are  creating permits its establishment, but the power to promulgate rules and  regulations will give rise to a strong man who may, in a desire to gratify his  personal ambitions, seize the reins of government."" (Page 391, Volume  Five, The Philippine Constitution, Its Origins, Making, Meaning, and  Application, a publication of the Philippine Lawyers Association, 1972.) Despite such eloquent warning, the  assembly voted down his motion. It is now contended that instead of declaring martial law,  President Marcos should have sought from Congress the approval of an emergency  powers act similar to Commonwealth Acts 600 and 671 passed respectively on  August 19, 1940, long before the Japanese invasion, and December 16, 1941, when  the Nippon Army was already on its way to Manila from Lingayen and other  landing points in the North. To start with, Congress was not unaware of the worsening  conditions of peace and order and of, at least, evident insurgency, what with  the numerous easily verifiable reports of open rebellious activities in  different parts of the country and the series of rallies and demonstrations,  often bloody, in Manila itself and other centers of population, including those  that reached not only the portals but even the session hall of the legislature,  but the legislators seemed not to be sufficiently alarmed or they either were  indifferent or did not know what to do under the circumstances. Instead of taking immediate measures to  alleviate the conditions denounced and decried by the rebels and the activists,  they debated and argued long on palliatives without coming out with anything  substantial, much less satisfactory in the eyes of those who were seditiously  shouting for reforms. In any event, in  the face of the inability of Congress to meet the situation, and prompted by  his appraisal of a critical situation that urgently called for immediate  action, the only alternative open to the President was to resort to the other  constitutional source of extraordinary powers, the Constitution itself. It is significant to note that Commonwealth Act 671 granted the  President practically all the powers of government. It provided as follows: ""Sec. 1. The existence  of war between the United States and other countries of Europe and Asia ,  which involves the Philippines ,  makes it necessary to invest the President with extraordinary powers in order  to meet the resulting emergency. ""Sec. 2. Pursuant to  the provisions of Article VI, section 16, of the Constitution, the President is  hereby authorized, during the existence of the emergency, to promulgate such  rules and regulations as he may deem necessary to carry out the national policy  declared in section 1 hereof. Accordingly,  he is, among other things, empowered (a) to transfer the seat of the Government  or any of its subdivisions, branches, departments, offices, agencies or  instrumentalities; (b) to reorganize the Government of the Commonwealth  including the determination of the order of precedence of the heads of the  Executive Departments; (c) to create new subdivisions, branches, departments,  offices, agencies or instrumentalities of government and to abolish any of  those already existing; (d) to continue in force laws and appropriations which  would lapse or otherwise become inoperative, and to modify or suspend the  operation or application of those of an administrative character; (e) to impose  new taxes or to increase, reduce, suspend, or abolish those in existence; (f)  to raise funds through the issuance of bonds or otherwise, and authorize the  expenditure of the proceeds thereof; (g) to authorize the National, provincial,  city or municipal governments to incur in overdrafts for purposes that he may  approve; (h) to declare the suspension of the collection of credits or the  payment of debts; and (i) to exercise such other powers as he may deem  necessary to enable the Government to fulfill its responsibilities and to  maintain and enforce its authority. ""Sec. 3. The President  of the Philippines shall as soon as practicable upon the convening of the Congress of the Philippines report thereto all the rules and regulations promulgated by him under the  powers herein granted. ""Sec. 4. This act shall  take effect upon its approval, and the rules and regulations promulgated  hereunder shall be in force and effect until the Congress of the Philippines shall otherwise provide."" From this extensive grant of immense  powers, it may be deduced that the difference between martial law and the  delegation of legislative power could be just a matter of procedure in that the  investment of authority in the former is by the Constitution while in the  latter it is by the Legislature. The  resulting constitutional situation is the same in both — government by the  Executive. It can be said that even the  primacy of military assistance in the discharge of government responsibilities  would be covered by the exercise of the delegated authority from Congress. What is most important, however, is that the Constitution does  not prohibit the declaration of martial law just because of the authority given  to the Legislative to invest the Executive with extraordinary powers. It is not to be supposed that in the face of  the inability or refusal of the Legislature to act, the people should be left helpless  and without a government to cope with the emergency of an internal or external  aggression. Much less is it logical to  maintain that it is the Supreme Court that is called upon to decide what  measures should be taken in the premises. Indeed, the fundamental law looks to the Executive to make the choice of  the means not only to repel the aggression but, as a necessary consequence, to  undertake such curative measures and reforms as are immediately available and  feasible to prevent the recurrence of the causes of the emergency. Petitioners are capitalizing on the pronouncements of this Court  in Lansang. We feel, however, that such  excessive reliance is not altogether well placed. The exact import of the Lansang doctrine is that it is within the  constitutional prerogative of the Supreme Court to inquire into the veracity of  the factual bases recited by the Executive in a proclamation ordering the  suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , for the  purpose of determining whether or not the Executive acted arbitrarily in  concluding from the evidence before him that there was indeed a rebellion and  that public necessity, as contemplated in the Constitution, required such  suspension. In other words, We held  therein that the issue of legality or illegality of a proclamation suspending  the Privilege is a justiciable one, in regard to which the Court could make  independent findings based on the evidence on which the President himself  acted. Actually, however, no real  hearing was held for the purpose in that case. What might perhaps be considered as such a  hearing was what took place on October 28 and 29, 1971, when, because of the  willingness expressed by the respondents therein to impart to the Court  classified information relevant to the cases, subject to appropriate security  measures, the Court met behind closed doors, and in the presence of three  attorneys representing the petitioners therein and the Solicitor General, it  was briefed by the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces and other ranking  military officials on said classified information, after which the parties were  granted time to file their respective memoranda of observations on the matters  revealed in the briefing, which they did. (See 42 SCRA, at pp. 466-467). In  the present cases there has been no such hearing, not even a briefing wherein  petitioners were represented. And it is  gravely doubtful whether any move in that direction would prosper, considering  there are not enough members of the Court, who believe in the juridical relevance  thereof, to constitute the required majority for a binding action to order such  a hearing or even just a similar briefing as before. Be that as it may, the important point is that Lansang case  referred to the extent of the powers of the Court in regard to a proclamation  suspending the Privilege whereas what is before Us now is a proclamation  imposing martial law. We hold that the  powers of the Executive involved in the two proclamations are not of the same  constitutional level and the prerogatives of the Court relative to habeas  corpus are distinct from those in the perspective of martial law. To start with, it is too evident to admit of dispute that the  aforequoted constitutional provision touching on the three powers of the  Executive, the calling of the armed forces, the suspension of the privilege and  the imposition of martial law contemplates varying and ascending degrees of  lawlessness and public disorder. While  it is true that textually any of the three courses of action mentioned may be  taken by the Executive on the occasion of an invasion, insurrection or  rebellion, the degree of resulting repression of individual rights under each  of them varies so substantially that it cannot be doubted that the constitution  contemplates that the determination as to which of them should be taken should  depend on the degree of gravity of the prevailing situation. In other words, it is the actual magnitude of  the rebellion to be suppressed and the degree and extent of danger to public  safety resulting therefrom that determines whether it should be the first, the  second or the third that should be taken, in order that there may be a direct  proportion between the degree of gravity of the crisis and the restraint of  individual rights and liberties. When  the situation is not very serious but is nevertheless beyond the control of the  regular peace authorities of the place affected, then the armed forces can be  called. Should the conditions  deteriorate in such a way as to involve a considerable segment of the population,  thereby making it difficult to maintain order and to differentiate the loyal  from the disloyal among the people, without detaining some of them, either  preventively or for their delivery to the proper authorities after the  emergency or as soon as it eases, then the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus may also be suspended. But  the moment the situation assumes very serious proportions, to the extent that  there is a breakdown of the regular government machinery either because the  officials cannot physically function or their functioning would endanger public  safety, martial law may be imposed. There is thus a marked gradation of the circumstances constituting  rebellion and danger to public safety in the provision, and it is to be  supposed that the measure to be adopted by the Executive should be that which  the situation demands. The calling of the armed forces is done by the Executive in his  capacity as Commander-in-Chief. The  power thus exercised is purely executive and does not cause any disturbance in  the constitutional order in the government. In the case of suspension of the Privilege, individual rights guaranteed  by the Bill of Rights are restrained, but otherwise the regular constitutional  machinery and the powers and functions of the different officials of the  government, including the courts, remain unaffected. Moreover, the suspension of the Privilege,  although premised on the demand of public safety, need not be necessarily  predicated on the requirements of national security as should be the case with  martial law. Again, the power exercised  in suspension is executive power and nothing more. But when martial law is proclaimed, there is,  as already observed earlier, a surrogation of the regular government machinery  by the constitutionally designated administrator with the aid of the  military. What is exercised in this  instance is not executive power alone but state power which involves the  totality of government authority, but without an actual military takeover, if  only because the civilian President remains at the head. In this connection, it is very important to note that whereas the  Bill of Rights explicitly prohibits the suspension of the Privilege of the writ  of habeas corpus except under the detailed circumstances prescribed  therein, including the limitations as to the time and place when and where it  may stay suspended, there is no similar injunction in regard to the imposition  of martial law. In other words, the  grant of the power to declare martial law in the Executive portion of the  Constitution is not countered, unlike in the case of habeas corpus , by a  prohibition in the Bill of Rights, the sanctuary of individual liberties. Invoking Lansang, petitioners argue that if an order of  suspension of the Privilege which involves less repression of constitutional  processes than martial law is reviewable by the courts, with more reason should  the imposition of martial law, whose effect upon the constitutional rights and  processes is more pervasive, be subject to a judicial test of constitutionality. Viewing it from the angle of individual  rights, the argument sounds plausible, but when it is considered that the  framers of the Bill of Rights never bothered to put the same or any similar  brakes to the imposition of martial law as that which they placed in regard to  suspension, it can be readily seen that because of the gravity of the crisis  predicating the extreme remedy of martial law, the constitution itself makes  the invocation of individual rights subordinate to the national interest involved  in the defense of the state against the internal aggression that confronts  it. From this consideration, it follows  that whatever standard of constitutionality was established by the Court in  Lansang relative to Suspension is not necessarily the measure of the powers the  Court can exercise over the Executive's proclamation of martial law. What the Constitution purposely and with good  reason differentiates, the Court may not equate. At any rate, We do not believe this is the proper occasion for  the Court to alter or modify what We said in Lansang. All that We say here is that Lansang does not  reach the martial law powers of the Executive, if only because that case  involved exclusively the question of legality of the detention, during the  Suspension, of some individuals, the petitioners therein, whereas here We are  dealing with the deprivation of liberty of petitioners as a direct consequence  of martial law, and in effect the real question before Us now is the legality  of the martial law regime itself, which, as already demonstrated, occupies a  different, level in the constitutional order of Executive power, specially when  considered from the point of view of the Bill of Rights. But even if We must refer to the considerations of the Court in  formulating Lansang, We cannot disregard the impact of contemporary  constitutional developments related thereto. The Constitutional Convention of 1971 had barely started its relevant  deliberations when Lansang was decided. It is to be assumed that the delegates were well informed about its  import. Indeed, they must have focused  their attention thereto when martial law was proclaimed in September of 1972,  if only because some of the delegates were apprehended and detained and had  forthwith filed the petitions now pending before Us. The delegates knew or ought to have known  that under the existing Constitution, the Bill of Rights made no mention of the  possible imposition of martial law in the section prohibiting the suspension of  the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus . Instead of seeing to it that in the charter  they were drafting the prohibition as to habeas corpus should be  extended to the declaration of martial law, in order to make the contingency  thereof as difficult as in the case of the former, they evidently found more  reason to concur in the construction pursued by President Marcos of the  prerogatives which the Constitution empowers him to utilize during a rebellion  or invasion. Accordingly, to erase  further doubts on the matter, the Convention enacted the transitory provision  earlier referred to making the Proclamation, among others, part of the law of  the land, which provision, We deem, at this point, not as a fiat placing the  Proclamation definitely beyond the pale of unconstitutionality, but as a contemporary  authoritative construction of the current charter by the body precisely called  to examine it carefully and determine its defects that should be corrected, to  the end that the rights of the people may be best safeguarded. Verily, such construction is entitled to due  respect from Us, particularly because it has been in effect, if not directly,  approved by the people, not only in the referendum of January 10-15, 1973  assailed by petitioners but in the other one held by secret ballot on July  27-28, 1973 under the supervision of the Commission on Elections. And in the light of such construction, Our  considered view is that Lansang is not controlling on the issues regarding  martial law involved in these cases. Perhaps, it may not be amiss to add here that although the  records of the Constitutional Convention of 1934 do not reveal the actual  reasons for the rejection of the amendment proposed by Delegate Vicente J.  Francisco to include in the Bill of Rights provision regarding habeas corpus the reference made to imminent danger of invasion, insurrection or rebellion in  the enumeration of the powers of the Executive relative to the same subject, it  is quite possible that in the mind of the convention it was not absolutely  necessary to suspend the Privilege when the danger is only imminent unless the  element of public safety involved already requires the imposition of martial  law. Relatedly, Delegate Araneta who as  earlier mentioned, proposed to subject the suspension of the Privilege to  legislative or judicial concurrence or review, and who appeared to be the most  bothered, among the delegates, about the exertion of executive power during the  emergencies contemplated, never said a word against the manner in which the  Executive was being granted the authority to impose martial law, much less  proposed any restriction upon it the way he did with the suspension of the  Privilege. This goes to show that the  feeling in the assembly was to regard martial law differently from the  suspension and to recognize that its imposition should not be trammeled nor  shackled by any provision of the Bill of Rights. — 6 — There are insurmountable pragmatic obstacles to the theory of  justiciability sustained by petitioners. The most important of this is that there is no known or  recognized procedure which can be adopted in the proposed inquiry into the  factual bases of the Executive's proclamation to insure that the degree of  judicious and fair hearing and determination of facts might be  approximated. Admittedly, the ordinary  rules of pleading, practice and evidence are out of the question. The relevant elemental facts are scattered  throughout the length and breadth of the country, and there is no conceivable  judicial camera that can catch the whole picture with adequate fidelity to the  truth. Perhaps judicial notice can help,  but the elements of public safety are not properly susceptible of judicial  notice when it comes to covert subversive activities. The problems of demonstration are manifold,  and when it is borne in mind that, in the very nature of things and under  universally accepted norms of state protection, there is a wall, impenetrable  even to the judiciary, behind which the state rightfully keeps away from other  Departments matters affecting national security, one will realize the futility  of believing that the Court can, assuming it were, by some curious way of  reasoning, legally required to do so, properly perform its judicial attributes  when it comes to determining in the face of an apparently nationwide rebellion,  whether or not martial law should be proclaimed by the Executive, instead of  resorting to the lesser remedies of calling the armed forces or suspending the  Privilege. Besides, for the Court to be  able to decide whether or not the action of the Executive is arbitrary, it  must, in justice to both parties, and to him in particular, act in the light of  the same evidence from which he drew his conclusion. How can such evidence be all gathered and  presented to the Court? Some members of the Court are of the firm conviction that it is  Our constitutional duty to indulge in the suggested inquiry, so We can be  assured in Our own conscience, and for the protection of the people, whether or  not President Marcos has acted arbitrarily. But prescinding from the difficulties of demonstration just discussed,  from what evidence is the Court going to draw its own conclusions in the cases  at bar, when We have not even been told what evidence the President had before  him, except those that may be inferred from the whereases of the Proclamation  which are disputed by petitioners? On  the other hand, how can We have all the evidence before Us, when in the very  nature thereof We cannot have access to them, since they must be kept under the  forbidding covers of national security regulations? Even the standing ordinary rules of evidence  provide in this respect thus: ""SEC. 21. Privileged communication . — xx xx xx xx xx xx (e) A public officer  cannot be examined during his term of office or afterwards, as to  communications made to him in official confidence, when the court finds that  the public interest would suffer by the disclosure."" (Rule 130, Revised  Rules of Court of the Philippines ). The inevitable conclusion is that the  Constitution must have intended that the decision of the Executive should be  his alone. If We should hold that the matter before Us is justiciable, the  practical result would be that even if the Court should now decide in the style  of Lansang that the President did not act arbitrarily in issuing the  Proclamation, We would have to be ready to entertain future petitions, one  after the other, filed by whosoever may be minded to allege, for his own  purpose, that conditions have so improved as to warrant the lifting of martial  law. Accordingly, every now and then the  Court would have to hear the parties and evaluate their respective  evidence. The Government would have to  appear and prove all over again the justifications for its action. The consequence would be that instead of  devoting his time to the defense of the nation, the President would be  preparing himself for the court battle. It is ridiculous to think that the members of the Constitutional Convention  had conceived placing such difficulties in the way of the Executive which make  of his function of defending the state a continuous running battle in two  separate fronts, one with the enemy and another with the courts. It is suggested that the Court can summarily  dismiss any such future petitions in cavalier fashion by simply holding on to  the finding We would make in these cases. But new allegations and arguments are bound to be made, and it is  definitely improper for Us to just summarily uphold the Executive everytime a  case comes up. What is more absurd is that the Supreme Court is not the only  court in which a petition to lift may be filed. Imagine if petitions were filed in two or three Courts of First  Instance, what would happen? In this  connection, We are in no position to enjoin the lower courts to entertain such  petitions because they may refer to the proposed lifting of martial law only in  the respective provinces where the courts are, and We cannot hold, precisely  because of Our own characterization of the nature of the issue as justiciable,  or more simply, that the Proclamation is subject to the review of factual bases  by the court, that any of said courts is without jurisdiction to entertain the  petition. Stated otherwise, every court  would then be open to pass on the reasonability or arbitrariness of the  President's refusal or failure to lift martial law. We do not mean to insinuate that the lower  court judges may not be prepared for the purpose, but the spectacle alone of  several of such petitions pending in various courts, without visualizing  anymore the potentiality of one judge or another upholding the proponent, is  something that will not only foreseeably complicate our international relations  but will also detract from our image as a people trained in the field of government. All of these considerations suggest again  that it is best that the Judiciary abstain from assuming a role not clearly  indicated in the Constitution to pertain to it. -C- THE SUPREME COURT ABSTAINS  FROM REVIEWING PROCLAMATION 1081, BECAUSE, IN THE LIGHT OF THE CONSIDERATIONS  HEREIN DISCUSSED, IT IS CONVINCED THAT THE CONSTITUTION CONTEMPLATES THAT THE  DECLARATION OF MARTIAL LAW SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY SOLELY OF THE  EXECUTIVE, BUT SHOULD ANY OCCASION OF OPEN DEFIANCE AND MANIFEST DISREGARD OF  THE PERTINENT CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION ARISE, THE COURT IS NOT POWERLESS TO  ""SUPPORT AND DEFEND"" THE CONSTITUTION. The greatest fear entertained by those who would sustain the  Court's authority to review the action of the President is that there might be  occasions when an Executive drunk with power might without rhyme or reason  impose martial law upon the helpless people, using the very Constitution itself  as his weapon of oppression to establish here a real dictatorship or  totalitarian government. The view is that  it is only the Supreme Court that can prevent such a dismal eventuality by  holding that it has the final authority and inescapable duty to define the  constitutional boundaries of the powers of the Executive and to determine in  every case properly brought before it whether or not any such power has been  abused beyond the limits set down by the fundamental law, and that unless We  hold here that the Court can determine the constitutional sufficiency of  Proclamation 1081 in fact and in law, the Filipino people would have no  protection against such an abusive Executive. We here declare emphatically that such apprehension is definitely  unfounded. Precisely, in this decision,  We are holding that the Court has the jurisdiction, the power and the authority  to pass on any challenge to an Executive's declaration of martial law alleged  in a proper case affecting private or individual rights to be unwarranted by  the Constitution. In these cases,  however, we do not see any need for the interposition of our authority. Instead what appears clear to Us, in the  light of the considerations We have discussed above, and so We hold, is that  the Solicitor General is eminently correct in contending that in the circumstantial  and constitutional milieu of the impugned Proclamation, We should abstain from  conducting the suggested inquiry to determine their constitutional sufficiency. In the way We see the martial law provision of the Constitution,  only two hypotheses can be considered relative to the Constitutional problem  before Us. Either the Executive acts in  conformity with the provision or he does not. In other words, either he imposes martial law because there is actually  a rebellion endangering the public safety or he does it for his own personal  desire to grab power, notwithstanding the absence of the factual grounds  required by the fundamental law. In the  latter case, the Court would have the constitutional power and duty to declare  the proclamation issued null and void. But to do this it does not have to conduct a judicial inquiry by the  reception of evidence. It should be  guided solely by facts that are of judicial notice. Thus, if the predicative recitals of the  proclamation are confirmed by facts of general public knowledge, obviously any  further inquiry would be superfluous. On  the other hand, in the contrary hypothesis, that is, it is publicly and  generally known that there is no rebellion of the nature and extent  contemplated in the Constitution, no amount of evidence offered by the  Executive can judicially create such a rebellion. Indeed, as observed elsewhere in this  opinion, a rebellion that does not come to the judicial notice of the Court  cannot warrant the imposition of martial law, particularly in reference to one  imposed over the whole country. But once  it is known to the Court by judicial notice that there is a rebellion, it would  constitute an undue interference with the constitutional duties and  prerogatives of the Executive for the Court to indulge in an inquiry as to the  constitutional sufficiency of his decision. Whether or not public safety requires the drastic action of imposing  martial law already involves the exercise of judgment, which as far as We can  see is committed to the responsibility of the Executive as the protector and  defender of the nation. Our considered  view is that in such circumstances, the Constitution rather expects the Court  to defer to his decision. Under this  concept of the powers of the Court relative to the exercise by the Executive of  his martial law prerogatives, the Court does not relinquish its authority as  guardian of the Constitution and the Executive, guided solely by his own sense  of responsibility under his solemn oath ""to defend and preserve"" the  Constitution, can proceed with his task of saving the integrity of the  government and the nation, without any fear that the Court would reverse his  judgment. To be sure, it could have sufficed for Us to point out, in answer  to the contention about possible abuse, that it is axiomatic in constitutional  law that the possibility that an official might abuse the powers conferred upon  him by law or by the Charter does not mean that the power does not exist or  should not be granted. This Court  affirmed this principle not only in Barcelon vs. Baker , quoted supra,  which was the precursor perhaps of the extreme of judicial self-restraint or  abstention in this jurisdiction but even in Angara vs. Electoral Commission ,  63 Phil. 139, reputedly the vanguard of judicial activism in the  Philippines. Justice Laurel postulated  reassuringly on this point in Angara thus: ""The possibility of abuse is not an  argument against the concession of power as there is no power that is not  susceptible of abuse"" (at p. 177). And We could have complemented this ratiocination with the observation  that it is most unlikely that the Filipino people would be penalized by Divine  Providence with the imposition upon them of an Executive with the frightening  characteristics ominously portrayed by those who advocate that the Court,  assuming its own immunity from being abusive, arbitrary or improvident, should  not recognize any constitutionally envisioned deference to the other  Departments of the Government, particularly the Executive. We can feel, however, that the people need further  reassurance. On this score, it is  opportune to recall that in Avelino vs. Cuenco , 83 Phil. 68, in spite of  the fact that in the Resolution of March 4, 1949, this Court refused to  intervene in the controversy between the parties as to whether or not there was  a valid election of a new President of the Senate, upon the ground that the  issue involved was purely political, in the subsequent Resolution of March 14,  1949, upon realizing that a critical situation, detrimental to the national  interest, subsisted as a consequence of its abstention, the Court reversed  itself and assumed the power to state categorically the correct solution to the  conflict based on its interpretation of the pertinent provisions of the  Constitution. Again, in January, 1962, in the space of several hours, 350 appointments  to different positions in the government, including Justices of the Supreme  Court and of the Court of Appeals and judges of the lower courts, fiscals,  officers of the Army, directors of bureaus, Governor of the Central Bank, and  others were sent by the President then to the Commission on Appointments on  December 29, 1961, the day preceding his last half-day in office, December 30,  1961. Upon the said appointments being  impugned in the Supreme Court, the Court, aghast by the number of and the speed  in the making of said appointments, the fact that they were made under  circumstances that betrayed not only lack of proper and deliberate  consideration of the qualifications of the appointees but also an evident  intent to deprive the succeeding President from filling the vacancies that had  been left vacant even after the results showing the defeat of the incumbent  President had already been publicly known and conceded, the departure from long  established practices in their preparation as well as the other undesirable  circumstances that surrounded the same, promptly struck them down as the  product of an improvident exercise of power, obnoxious to the precepts  underlying the principled government conceived in the Constituion. 15 The violation of the spirit and intent of the Constitution appeared manifest to  the Court on the basis of facts which were mainly if not all of judicial notice  and, therefore, needed no further demonstration in an inquiry or investigation  by the Court. Under more or less a  similar setting of circumstances, which occurred in the latter part of the term  of the President whose tenure expired on December 30, 1965, the Supreme Court  reiterated the above ruling in Guevara vs. Inocentes , 16 SCRA 379. Thus everyone can see that when situations arise which on their  faces and without the need of inquiry or investigation reveal an unquestionable  and palpable transgression of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has never  been without means to uphold the Constitution, the policy of judicial self-restraint  implicit therein notwithstanding. The  precedents just related relate to peaceful controversies, and, of course, the  alleged violation of the Constitution by the Executive in the exercise of a  power granted to him to meet the exigencies of rebellion and the dangers to  public safety it entails has to be considered from a different  perspective. Even then, the Supreme  Court would not be powerless to act. Until all of its members are incarcerated or killed and there are not  enough of them to constitute a quorum, the Court would always be there ready to  strike down a proclamation of martial law as unconstitutional, whenever from  the facts manifest and generally known to the people and to it, and without its  having conducted any inquiry by the reception of evidence, it should appear  that the declaration is made without any rational basis whatsoever and is  predicated only on the distorted motives of the Executive. For as long, however, as the recitals or  grounds given in a proclamation accord substantially with facts of judicial  notice, either because they are of public knowledge or are by their nature  capable of unquestionable demonstration, We have no reason to interfere with  the discharge by the Executive of a responsibility imposed upon him by the Constitution  and in which there is no indication therein that the Court should share. But when, as just stated, it is generally  known or it is of public knowledge that there is no rebellion or, there being  one, that it poses no conceivable danger to the public safety, and, God forbid,  martial law is proclaimed, the Court, even without the need of any kind of  judicial inquiry into the facts alleged in the proclamation, will certainly act  and declare the pretentious Executive a constitutional outlaw, with the result  that the regular government established by the Constitution may continue in the  hands of those who are constitutionally called upon to succeed him, unless he  overcomes the legitimate government by force. In truth, such is the only way the Supreme Court should act in  discharging its duty to uphold the Constitution by the use of the judicial  power, if it is to give to the Executive or the Legislature, as the case may  be, the due regard that the Constitution contemplates should be accorded to  them in consideration of their own functions and responsibilities implicit in  the principle of separation of powers embodied therein. II THE CONSTITUTION IS MERELY IN A STATE OF ANAESTHESIA ,  SINCE A MAJOR SURGERY IS NEEDED TO SAVE THE NATION'S LIFE. The foregoing discussion covers, as must have been noted, the  resolution not only of the issue of jurisdiction raised by the respondents but  also of the corollary question of the application of the Lansang doctrine. Not only that, from what has been said, it is  obvious that since it is to the President that the Constitution has committed  the discretion to impose martial law, it follows that he alone should have the  discretion and the prerogative to declare when it should cease or be  lifted. Exactly the same considerations  compelling the conclusion that the Court may not review the constitutional  sufficiency of his proclamation of martial law make it ineludible to conclude  that the people have also left it to the Executive to decide when conditions  would permit the full restoration of the regular constitutional processes. With characteristic perceptive insight, in  his thesis to be cited infra , Justice Guillermo S. Santos of the Court  of Appeals, discourses on this point as follows: ""44. When Martial Rule is  Terminated - In both England and the United States martial rule terminates ipso facto upon the cessation of the  public emergency that called it forth. To this proposition there has been no dissent. Martial rule must cease when the public  safety no longer require its further exercise. ""45. Who Terminates Martial Rule - Since the declaration of martial rule has been committed to the  judgment of the President, it follows that its termination is to be fixed by  the same authority. (Barcelon vs .  Baker, 1905, 5 Phil. 87.) Again, to this view there cannot be any valid  objection. It would seem only natural  that since the President has been expressly authorized to declare martial rule  no other authority should be permitted to terminate it."" (Martial Law,  Nature, Principles and Administration by Guillermo S. Santos, p. 75.) Needless to say, it is our Constitution  that controls in the cases at bar, not the American theory. In fact, when President Laurel proclaimed  martial law during the Second World War, he expressly provided, to avoid any  doubt about the matter, thus: ""8. The proclamation  of martial law being an emergency measure demanded by imperative necessity, it  shall continue as long as the need for it exists and shall terminate upon  proclamation of the President of the Republic of the Philippines ."" In the interest of truth and to set Our perspective aright, it  may not be said that under Proclamation 1081 and the manner in which it has  implemented, there has been a total suspension, much less an abrogation of the  Constitution. Even textually, the  ensuing orders issued by the President have left virtually unaltered the  established constitutional order in all levels of government and society except  those that have to be adjusted and subjected to potential changes demanded by  the necessities of the situation and the attainment of the objectives of the  declaration. Repeatedly and  emphatically, the President has solemnly reassured the people that there is no  military takeover and that the declared principle in the Constitution that  ""Civilian authority is at all times supreme over the military""  (Section 8, Article II, 1973 Charter) shall be rigorously observed. And earlier in this opinion, We have already  discussed how he restored the security of tenure of the members of the Court  and how the judicial power has been retained by the courts, except in those  cases involving matters affecting national security and public order and safety  which the situation demands should be dealt with by the executive arms of the  government. When President Lincoln proclaimed martial law in Kentucky in 1864, he did not completely overhaul the existing machinery, he let it  continue insofar as it did not obstruct the military operations and related  activities. He ordered thus: ""Whereas many citizens of the State of Kentucky have joined  the forces of the insurgents, and such insurgents have, on several occasions,  entered the said State of Kentucky in large force, and, not without aid and  comfort furnished by disaffected and disloyal citizens of the United States  residing therein, have not only disturbed the public peace, but have overborne  the civil authorities and made flagrant civil war, destroying property and life  in various parts of the State: And  whereas it has been made known to the President of the United States by the  officers commanding the national armies, that combinations have been formed in  the said State of Kentucky with a purpose of inciting rebel forces to renew the  said operations of civil war within the said State, and thereby to embarrass  the United States armies now operating in the said States of Virginia and  Georgia, and even to endanger their safety: x x 'The martial law herein proclaimed, and the things in that respect  herein ordered, will not be deemed or taken to interfere with the holding of  lawful elections, or with the proceedings of the constitutional legislature of  Kentucky, or with the administration of justice in the courts of law existing  therein between citizens of the United States in suits or proceedings which do  not affect the military operations or the constituted authorities of the  government of the United States."" (Martial Law, Nature, Principles and  Administration by Guillermo S. Santos, pp. 97-98.) Incidentally, there is here a clear repudiation  of the open court theory, and what is more, even the holding of regular  elections and legislative sessions were not suppressed. 16 Accordingly, the undeniable fact that the Philippine Congress was in session,  albeit about to adjourn, when martial law was declared on September 21, 1972 is  not necessarily an argument against the exercise by the President of the power  to make such a declaration. President Laurel's own declaration of martial law during the  Japanese occupation did not involve a total blackout of constitutional  government. It reads in its pertinent  portions thus: “x x x “4. All existing laws  shall continue in force and effect until amended or repealed by the President,  and all the existing civil agencies of an executive character shall continue  exercising their powers and performing their functions and duties, unless they  are inconsistent with the terms of this Proclamation or incompatible with the  expeditious and effective enforcement of martial law herein declared. “5. It shall be the duty  of the Military Governors to suppress treason, sedition, disorder and violence;  and to cause to be punished all disturbances of public peace and all offenders  against the criminal laws; and also to protect persons in their legitimate  rights. To this end and until otherwise  decreed, the existing courts of justice shall assume jurisdiction and try  offenders without unnecessary delay and in a summary manner, in accordance with  such procedural rules as may be prescribed by the Minister of Justice. The decisions of courts of justice of the  different categories in criminal cases within their original jurisdiction shall  be final and unappealable: Provided,  however , That no sentence of death shall be carried into effect without the  approval of the President. “6. The existing courts of  justice shall continue to be invested with, and shall exercise, the same  jurisdiction in civil actions and special proceedings as are now provided in  existing laws, unless otherwise directed by the President of the Republic of the  Philippines."" Proclamation 1081 is in no sense any more constitutionally  offensive. In fact, in ordering  detention of persons, the Proclamation pointedly limits arrests and detention  only to those ""presently detained, as well as all others who may hereafter  be similarly detained for the crimes of insurrection or rebellion, and all  other crimes and offenses committed in furtherance or on the occasion thereof,  or incident thereto, or in connection therewith, for crimes against national  security and the laws of nations, crimes against public order, crimes involving  usurpation of authority, rank, title and improper use of names, uniforms and  insignia, crimes committed by public officers, and for such other crimes as  will be enumerated in orders that I shall subsequently promulgate, as well as  crimes as a consequence of any violation of any decree, order or regulation  promulgated by me personally or promulgated upon my direction."" Indeed, even in the affected areas, the Constitution has not been  really suspended much less discarded. As  contemplated in the fundamental law itself, it is merely in a state of anaesthesia,  to the end that the much needed major surgery to save the nation's life may be  successfully undertaken. III THE IMPOSITION OF MARTIAL LAW AUTOMATICALLY  CARRIES WITH IT THE SUSPENSION OF THE PRIVILEGE OF THE WRIT OF HABEAS  CORPUS. IN ANY EVENT, THE  PRESIDENTIAL ORDER OF ARREST AND DETENTION CANNOT BE ASSAILED AS DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. The next issue to consider is that which refers to the arrest and  continued detention and other restraints of the liberties of petitioners, and  their main contention in this respect is that the proclamation of martial law  does not carry with it the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus , hence petitioners are entitled to immediate release from their  constraints. We do not believe such contention needs extended exposition or  elaboration in order to be overruled. The primary and fundamental purpose of martial law is to maintain order  and to insure the success of the battle against the enemy by the most  expeditious and efficient means without loss of time and with the minimum of  effort. This is self-evident. The arrest and detention of those  contributing to the disorder and especially of those helping or otherwise  giving aid and comfort to the enemy are indispensable, if martial law is to  mean anything at all. This is but  logical. To fight the enemy, to maintain  order amidst riotous chaos and military operations, and to see to it that the  ordinary constitutional processes for the prosecution of law-breakers are three  functions that cannot humanly be undertaken at the same time by the same  authorities with any fair hope of success in any of them. To quote from Malcolm and Laurel, ""Martial  law and the privilege of that writ (of habeas corpus) are wholly  incompatible with each other."" (Malcolm and Laurel, Philippine  Constitutional Law, p. 210). It simply  is not too much for the state to expect the people to tolerate or suffer  inconveniences and deprivations in the national interest, principally the  security and integrity of the country. Mere suspension of the Privilege may be ordered, as discussed  earlier, when the situation has not reached very critical proportions  imperilling the very existence of the nation, as long as public safety demands  it. It is, therefore, absurd to contend,  that when martial law, which is precisely the ultimate remedy against the  gravest emergencies of internal or external aggression, is proclaimed, there is  no suspension of the Privilege unless this is separately and distinctly  ordered. Considering that both powers  spring from the same basic causes, it stands to reason that the graver sanction  includes the lesser. It is claimed that  President Laurel treated the two matters separately in his aforequoted  proclamation. We do not believe that the  precedent cited controls. It only proves  that to avoid any doubt, what President Laurel did may be adopted. There can be no denying the point that  without suspension of the Privilege, martial law would certainly be  ineffective. Since martial law involves  the totality of government authority, it may he assumed that by ordering the  arrest and detention of petitioners and the other persons mentioned in the  Proclamation, until ordered released by him, the President has by the tenor of  such order virtually suspended the Privilege. Relatedly, as pointed out by the  Solicitor General, no less than petitioner Diokno himself postulated in a  lecture at the U.P. Law Center that: ""There are only, as far as I know, two instances where persons  may be detained without warrant but with due process. The first is in cases of martial law or when  the writ of habeas corpus is suspended. In those cases, it is not that their  detention is legal, it is that we cannot inquire into the legality of their  detention. Because martial law means  actually the suspension of law and the substitution of the will of our  Congress. The second instance is that  which is provided for in Rule 113, section 6 of the Rules of Court and Section  37 of the Revised Charter of the City of Manila . Essentially it consists of cases where the  crime is committed right in the presence of the person who is making the arrest  or detention."" (Trial Problems in City & Municipal Courts, 1970 p.  267, U.P. Law Center Judicial Conference Series.) In his well documented and very carefully prepared and  comprehensive thesis on Martial Law, Nature, Principles and Administration,  Published by Central Lawbook Publishing Co. Inc. in 1972, Justice Guillermo S.  Santos of the Court of Appeals and formerly of the Judge Advocate General's  Service, Armed Forces of the Philippines ,  makes these pointed observations: ""Whether the existence of martial law and the suspension of  the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus ‘are one and the same thing',  or 'the former includes the latter and much more,' had been the subject of 'an  angry war of pamphlets between Professors Parsons and Parker of the Harvard Law  School at the outbreak of the Civil War.' (Fairman, p. 43; Wiener, p. 9.) It  has also been a difficult question to decide in some jurisdictions whether the  suspension of the privilege of the writ amounted to a declaration of martial  law. (Winthrop, pp. 820 & 828,  citing Ex parte Field, 9 Am. L.R. 507; Bouvier's Law Dictionary,  3rd Francis Rawis Ed., 1914, p. 2105, citing 1 Halleck, Int. Law 549.) ""In the face of the constitutional provisions (Art. III, Sec.  1, Clause [14] and fn 9, supra.) in our jurisdiction, there seems to be no room  for doubt that the two are different. While the grounds for the suspension of the privilege of the writ and  the proclamation of martial law are the same, there can be no question that  suspension of the writ means what it says, that during the suspension of the  privilege, the writ, if issued, will be to no avail; but martial law has more  than just this effect. The only question  which apparently remains to be determined herein, is, whether the declaration  of martial law ipso facto carries with it the suspension of the  privilege of the writ, or whether a declaration of martial law must necessarily  include a declaration suspending the privilege of the writ in order to consider  the same inoperative. But it appears  that the former is the better view, (Malcolm and Laurel, Philippine  Constitutional Law, p. 310) although in United States it has been held that  qualified martial rule may exist where the writ has, in legal contemplation,  not been suspended, (Fairman, p. 44) and that the status of martial law does  not of itself suspend the writ. (Military Law (Domestic Disturbances), Basic Field Manual, War  Department, [US] fn. 19 & 15, p. 17 [1945].)"" (See pp. 41-42.) Of course, We are not bound by the rule  in other jurisdictions. Former Dean Vicente G. Sinco of the College of Law of the  University of the Philippines, of which he became later on President, a noted  authority on constitutional law from whom many of us have learned the subject,  likewise sustains the view that the proclamation of martial law automatically  suspends the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus . (V. Sinco, Phil. Political Law, p. 259, 11th  Ed., 1962) Now, as to the constitutional propriety of detaining persons on  suspicion of conspiracy with the enemy without the need of the regular judicial  process, We have also the authoritative support of no less than what a  distinguished member of this Court, considered as one of the best informed in  American constitutional law, Mr. Justice Enrique Fernando, and the principal  counsel of petitioners, former Senator Tañada, himself an authority, on the  subject, had to say on the point in their joint authorship, used as textbook in  many law schools, entitled Constitution of the Philippines, to wit: ""Once martial law has been declared, arrest may be necessary  not so much for punishment but by way of precaution to stop disorder. As long as such arrests are made in good  faith and in the honest belief they are needed to maintain order, the  President as Commander-in-Chief, cannot thereafter, when he is out of  office, be subjected to an action on the ground that he had no reasonable  ground for his belief. When it comes  to a decision by the head of the state upon a matter involving its life, the  ordinary rights of individuals must yield to what he deems the necessities of  the moment. Public danger warrants the  substitution of executive process for judicial process ."" (Emphasis  supplied. (Constitution of the Philippines by Tañada & Fernando, Vol. 2.  pp. 523-525.) The authority cited by Justice Fernando and Senator Tañada says: 'The plaintiff’s position, stated in a few words, is that the  action of the governor, sanctioned to the extent that it was by the decision of  the Supreme Court, was the action of the state and therefore within the 14th  Amendment; but that, if that action was unconstitutional, the governor got no  protection from personal liability for his unconstitutional interference with  the plaintiffs rights. It is admitted,  as it must be, that the governor's declaration that a state of insurrection  existed is conclusive of that fact. It  seems to be admitted also that the arrest alone would not necessarily have  given a right to bring this suit. Luther vs. Borden, 7 How. 1, 45, 46, 12 L. ed. 581, 600, 601. But it is said that a detention for so many  days, alleged to be without probable cause, at a time when the courts were  open, without an attempt to bring the plaintiff before them, makes a case on  which he has a right to have a jury pass. ""We shall not consider all of the questions that the facts  suggest, but shall confine ourselves to stating what we regard as a sufficient  answer to the complaint, without implying that there are not others equally  good. Of course, the plaintiff’s  position is that he has been deprived of his liberty without due process of  law. But it is familiar that what is due  process of law depends on circumstances. It varies with the subject-matter and the necessities of the  situation. Thus, summary proceedings suffice  for taxes, and executive decisions for exclusion from the country. Den ex dem. Murray vs. Hoboken Land & Improve. Co . 18 How. 272, 15 L. ed.  372; United States vs. Ju Toy , 198 U.S. 253, 263, 49 L. ed. 1040, 1044, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644. What, then, are the circumstances of this  case? By agreement the record of the  proceedings upon habeas corpus was made part of the complaint, but that  did not make the averments of the petition for the writ averments of the  complaint. The facts that we are to  assume are that a state of insurrection existed and that the governor, without  sufficient reason, but in good faith, in the course of putting the insurrection  down, held the plaintiff until he thought that he safely could release him. ""It would seem to be admitted by the plaintiff that he was  president of the Western Federation of Miners, and that, whoever was to blame,  trouble was apprehended with the members of that organization. We mention these facts not as material, but  simply to put in more definite form the nature of the occasion on which the  governor felt called upon to act. In such  a situation we must assume that he had a right, under the state Constitution  and laws, to call out troops, as was held by the supreme court of the  state. The Constitution is supplemented  by an act providing that 'when an invasion of or insurrection in the state is  made or threatened, the governor shall order the national guard to repel or  suppress the same. Laws of 1897, chap.  83, art. 7, & 2, p. 204. That means  that he shall make the ordinary use of the soldiers to that end; that he may  kill persons who resist and, of course, that he may use the milder measure of  seizing the bodies of those whom he considers to stand in the way of restoring  peace. Such arrests are not necessarily  for punishment, but are by way of precaution, to prevent the exercise of  hostile power. So long as such arrests  are made in good faith and in the honest belief that they are needed in order  to head the insurrection off, the governor is the final judge and cannot be  subjected to an action after he is out of office, on the ground that he had not  reasonable ground for his belief. If we  suppose a governor with a very long term of office, it may be that a case could  be imagined in which the length of the imprisonment would raise a different  question. But there is nothing in the  duration of the plaintiff’s detention or in the allegations of the complaint  that would warrant submitting the judgment of the governor to revision by a  jury. It is not alleged that his  judgment was not honest, if that be material, or that the plaintiff was  detained after fears of the insurrection were at an end. No doubt there are cases where the expert on the spot may be called  upon to justify his conduct later in court, notwithstanding the fact that he  had sole command at the time and acted to the best of his knowledge. That is the position of the captain of a  ship. But, even in that case, great  weight is given to his determination, and the matter is to be judged on the  facts as they appeared then, and not merely in the light of the event. Lawrence vs. Minturn , 17 How. 100, 110, 15 L. ed. 58, 62; The Star of Hope , 9  Wall, 203, 19 L. ed. 638; The Germanic (Oceanic Steam Nay. Co. vs. Aitken ) 196 U.S. 589, 594, 595, 49 L. Ed. 610, 613, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 317.) When it comes to a  decision by the head of the state upon a matter involving its life, the  ordinary rights of individuals must yield to what he deems the necessities of  the moment. Public danger warrants the  substitution of executive process for judicial process. See Keely vs . Sanders, 99 U.S. 441, 446, 25 L. ed. 327, 328."" ( Moyer vs. Peabody ,  212 U.S. 416, 417 ). Relatedly, in the decision of the Supreme Court of Colorado  dealing with the same detention of Charles II Moyer by order of the state  governor, it was held: ""By the reply it is alleged that, notwithstanding the  proclamation and determination of the Governor that a state of insurrection  existed in the country of San Miguel, that as a matter of fact these conditions  did not exist at the time of such proclamation or the arrest of the petitioner,  or at any other time. By S 5, art. 4, of  our Constitution, the governor is the commander in chief of the military forces  of the state, except when they are called into actual service of the United    States ; and he is thereby empowered to call  out the militia to suppress insurrection. It must therefore become his duty to determine as a fact when conditions  exist in a given locality which demand that, in the discharge of his duties as  chief executive of the state, he shall employ the militia to suppress. This being true, the recitals in the  proclamation to the effect that a state of insurrection existed in the county of San Miguel cannot  be controverted. Otherwise, the  legality of the orders of the executive would not depend upon his judgment, but  the judgment of another coordinate branch of the state government . . . "". . . lf, then, the military may resort to the extreme of  taking human life in order to suppress insurrection, it is impossible to  imagine upon what hypothesis it can be successfully claimed that the  milder means of seizing the persons of those participating in the  insurrection or aiding and abetting it may not be resorted to . This is but a lawful means to the end to be  accomplished. The power and authority of  the militia in such circumstances are not unlike that of the police of a city,  or the sheriff of a county, aided by his deputies or possee comitatus in  suppressing a riot. Certainly such  officials would be justified in arresting the rioters and placing them in jail  without warrant, and detaining them there until the riot was suppressed. Hallett, J., in Re Application of Sherman  Parker (no opinion for publication). lf,  as contended by counsel for petitioner, the military, as soon as a rioter or  insurrectionist is arrested, must turn him over to the civil authorities of the  county, the arrest might, and in many instances would, amount to a mere farce. He could be released on bail, and left free  to again join the rioters or engage in aiding and abetting their action, and,  if again arrested, the same process would have to be repeated, and thus the  action of the military would be rendered a nullity. Again, if it be conceded that, on the arrest  of a rioter by the military, he must at once be turned over to the custody of  the civil officers of the county, then the military, in seizing armed  insurrectionists and depriving them of their arms, would be required to  forthwith return them to the hands of those who were employing them in acts of  violence; or be subject to an action of replevin for their recovery, whereby  immediate possession of such arms would be obtained by the rioters, who would  thus again be equipped to continue their lawless conduct. To deny the right of the militia to detain  those whom they arrest while engaged in suppressing acts of violence and until  order is restored would lead to the most absurd results . The arrest and detention of an  insurrectionist, either actually engaged in acts of violence or in aiding and  abetting others to commit such acts, violates none of his constitutional  rights. He is not tried by any military  court, or denied the right of trial by jury; neither is he punished for  violation of the law, nor held without due process of law. His arrest and detention in such  circumstances are merely to prevent him from taking part or aiding in a  continuation of the conditions which the governor, in the discharge of his  official duties and in the exercise of authority conferred by law, is  endeavoring to suppress. When this end  is reached, he could no longer be restrained of his liberty by the military,  but must be, just as respondents have indicated in their return to the writ,  turned over to the usual civil authorities of the county, to be dealt with in  the ordinary course of justice, and tried for such offenses against the law as  he may have committed. It is true that  petitioner is not held by virtue of any warrant, but if his arrest and  detention are authorized by law, he cannot complain because those steps have  not been taken which are ordinarily required before a citizen can be arrested  and detained. “…The same power which determines the existence of an  insurrection must also decide when the insurrection has been suppressed.” (Emphasis  added.) (Re Moyer, 35 Colo. 159, 85 Pac. 190 [1904].) It is evident, therefore, that regardless  of whether or not the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is  expressly suspended during martial law, arrest, detention and other restraints  of liberty of individuals may not be assailed as violative of the due process  clause. The Presidential orders to such  effect constitute substantive and procedural due process at the same time and  may therefore be invoked as valid defenses against any remedy or prayer for  release. Given the validity of the declaration  of martial law, the sole tests of legality of constraints otherwise frowned  upon in normal times by the fundamental law are substantial relevance and  reasonableness. In the very nature of  things, and absent any obvious showing of palpable bad faith, the Executive  should enjoy respectful deference in the determination of his grounds. As a rule, the Courts are not supposed to  make any inquiry into the matter. We accordingly hold that, as well demonstrated by the Solicitor  General, a proclamation of martial law automatically results in the suspension  of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and, therefore, the  arrest, detention and restraints upon petitioners are authorized by the  Constitution. In any event, the  Presidential order of arrest and detention constitute due process and is,  therefore, a valid defense to any allegation of illegality of the constraints  upon petitioners. We further hold that  the duration of such constraints may be co-extensive with martial law unless  otherwise ordered by the Executive. IV THE EFFECT OF THE APPROVAL AND RATIFICATION  OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION ON THE INSTANT PETITIONS All that remains now for resolution is the question of what  effect did the approval and ratification of the New Constitution have upon the  instant petitions? When petitioners came to this Court in September and October 1972  to impugn the legality of their arrest and detention by virtue of Proclamation  1081 and General Order No. 2, their common fundamental theory was that said  proclamation and order were violative of the Constitution of the Philippines of  1935, not only because, according to them, there was no justification for its  placing the country under martial law but also because, even assuming its  propriety, there was allegedly no legal basis for the apprehension and  detention of petitioners without any warrant of arrest and without even any  charges being filed against them. Thus,  in his return of the writ of habeas corpus issued by the Court, as well  as in his oral argument at the hearings, the Solicitor General limited himself  to barely invoking the provision of the said Constitution empowering the  President to proclaim martial law, even as he denied the allegation that there  was no factual basis therefor, and simply contended that the arrest and  detention of petitioners were made pursuant to orders validly issued under the  powers of the President flowing from the proclamation. — A — As already noted, however, even before these cases could be  submitted for decision, on November 30, 1972, the Constitutional Convention of  1971 approved a draft constitution designed to supersede the Constitution of  1935 and on January 17, 1973, thru Proclamation 1102, the President declared  that draft constitution to have been ratified by the people in the referendum  of January 10-15, 1973, and, as also stated earlier, said proclamation became  the subject of two series of cases in this Court which ultimately ended with  the decision of March 31, 1973 adjudging that ""there is no further  judicial obstacle to the New Constitution being considered in force and  effect."" And among the salient and pertinent provisions of the New  Constitution or the Constitution of 1973 as the new charter may distinctively  be referred to, is that of Section 3 (2) of Article XVII textually reproduced  earlier above. In view of the comprehensive or all-inclusive tenor of the  constitutional injunction contained in said provision, referring as it does to  ""all proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions, and acts promulgated,  issued, or done by the incumbent President"", there can be no doubt that  Proclamation 1081 and General Order No. 2, herein assailed by petitioners, are  among those enjoined to be ""part of the law of the land."" The  question that arises then is, did their having been made part of the law of the  land by no less than an express mandate of the fundamental law preclude further  controversy as to their validity and efficacy? In pondering over this question, it is important to bear in mind  the circumstances that attended the framing and final approval of the draft  constitution by the Convention. As  already noted, two actuations of the President of indubitable transcendental  import overtook the deliberation of the constituent assembly, namely, the  issuance by him of Proclamation 1081 placing the Philippines under martial law and his exercise, under said proclamation, of non-executive  powers, inclusive of general legislative authority. As to be expected in a country, like the  Philippines, long accustomed to strict constitutionalism and the superiority of  civilian authority over the military, soon enough, these two actuations spawned  constitutional controversies of serious dimensions, so much so that several  cases involving them, including the instant ones, are now pending in the  Supreme Court. Surely, the members of  the Convention were well aware of these developments. In other words, the delegates in convention  assembled were living witnesses of the manner in which, for the first time in  our constitutional history, the martial law clause of the charter was being  actually implemented and they knew the grave constitutional issues such  implementation had provoked. Indeed, no constituent assembly could have been better  circumstanced to formulate the fundamental law of the land. The Convention had a full and first-hand view  of the controversial operation of the most important part of the charter it was  called to improve upon — its martial law clause. Verily, no other aspect of the constitution  could have commanded more the most serious attention of the delegates. They knew or ought to have known that the  placing of the country or any part thereof under martial law could possibly  affect the continued operation therein of the constitution or at least, the  enforceability of particular provisions thereof. Therefore, if the Convention felt that what  was being done by the President as witnessed by them was not within the  contemplation of the existing fundamental law or that it was inconsistent with  the underlying principles of democracy and constitutionalism to which the  nation has been irrevocably committed since its birth and which were to remain  as the foundations of the new charter, the delegates would have considered it  to be their bounden duty to our people and to the future generations of  Filipinos, to manifest their conviction by providing appropriate safeguards  against any repetition thereof in the constitution they were drafting. And so, when it is considered that as finally  approved, the New Constitution reproduces in exactly the same terms or verbatim  the martial law clause of the 1935 charter, the ineludible conclusion is that  our new constitutional fathers did not see anything repugnant to the concept of  the old constitution in what the President has done or was doing. As We see it, this attitude of the Convention  constitutes an authoritative contemporary construction of the provision in  controversy, and considering that the President's manner of implementing  martial law has been sanctioned by the people not only in the referendum of  January 10-15, 1973 but also in that of July 27-28, 1973, reliance on such  attitude in determining the meaning and intent of said provision cannot be out  of place. In the light of these considerations, We do not see in the  transitory provision under discussion any idea of ratification or validation of  something void or unauthorized. Rather,  what We perceive in it are revelations of what lay in the core of the martial  law clause of the 1935 Constitution as it was conceived and formulated by its  wise and farsighted framers. It would be  unreasonable, illogical and unworthy of the 1971 delegates to impute to them an  intent to merely ratify, confirm or validate the President's acts, on the  assumption that they were originally unauthorized by the charter, for that  would imply that they were concerned only about straightening out the present  situation, when it is just as important to insure that future acts of the  President are not tainted with illegality. We cannot entertain any thought that the delegates were not sufficiently  apprised on the implications of their acts. Indeed, the New Constitution has not imparted ex propio vigore any element of validity to the acts in question, it has only expressed in black  and white what the Old Constitution did not deem necessary to lay down with  precision in respect to them. Viewed  this way, what the transitory provision under discussion means is that both the  acts of the President before as well as those after ratification of the New  Constitution are valid ? not validated — and, as just stated, what reinforces  this construction and places the said acts beyond possible attacks for  unconstitutionality are the results of the two referendums of January and July,  1973. Withal, having absolute faith in the high sense of duty and the  patriotic courage of the members of the Convention, We also reject the  suggestion that they were in any way impeded, under the circumstances then  obtaining, from freely expressing themselves. We cannot for a moment entertain the thought that any other Filipino can  ever have less courage and love of country and concern for the future of our  people than the members of this Court who are presently called upon to make  momentous decisions affecting no less than the legality and legitimacy of the  very Government admittedly in effective control of the whole territory of the  nation, regardless of possible personal consequences to themselves. The fact of the matter is that Proclamation 1081 did not make  mention of the Convention at all. On the  contrary, judicial notice may be taken of the increased funds appropriated by  the President so as to enable it to proceed with its deliberations, unbothered  by any apprehension regarding the inadequacy of the funds which the Congress  had appropriated for it, and which were then fast dwindling, without any certainty  of further congressional appropriations. Indeed, when Delegate Kalaw of the First District of Rizal proposed in a  formal resolution that the sessions be suspended until after the lifting of  martial law, the assembly voted overwhelmingly to turn down the proposal. There is no evidence at all that any form of  undue pressure was brought to bear upon the delegates in any respect related to  their constituent functions. It has not  been shown that the arrest and detention of a number of delegates, some of whom  are petitioners herein, was in any way connected with or caused by their  actuations related to their constituent functions. What General Order No. 2 asserts is that the  President ordered the ""Secretary of National Defense to forthwith arrest  or cause the arrest and take into custody the individuals named in the attached  list (among them, the said delegates) and to hold them until otherwise so  ordered by me or my duly designated representative"" for their ""being  active participants or for having given aid and comfort in the conspiracy to  seize political and state power in the country and to take over the Government  by force, the extent of which has now assumed the proportion of an actual war  against our people and our legitimate Government and in order to prevent them  from further committing acts that are inimical or injurious to our people, the  Government and our national interest, and to hold said individuals until  otherwise so ordered by me or by my duly designated representative."" Even  then, said delegates were allowed to cast their votes in the assembly when the  final draft was submitted for approval of the members of the Convention. Thus, it can be safely asserted that the  freedom of the Convention to act and to perform whatever was incumbent upon it  as a constituent body suffered no substantial diminution or constraint on  account of the proclamation of martial law. To reiterate then, Section 3 (2), Article XVII of the New  Constitution enjoins that ""all proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions  and acts promulgated, issued or done by the incumbent President shall be part  of the law of the land and shall remain valid, legal, binding and effective  even after the lifting of martial law or the ratification of this Constitution,  unless modified, revoked, or superseded by subsequent proclamations, orders,  decrees, instructions or other acts of the incumbent President, or unless  expressly and explicitly modified or repealed by the regular National  Assembly."" Notably, the provision does not only make all such  proclamations, orders, decrees, etc. ""part of the law of the land"",  in which case, it would have been perhaps possible to argue, that they had just  been accorded the status of legislative enactments, ordinarily subject to possible  attack on constitutional grounds. The  provision actually goes further. It  expressly ordains that the proclamations, orders, etc. referred to should  ""remain valid, legal, binding, and effective"" . . . until revoked,  modified, repealed or superseded in the manners therein stipulated. What is more, the provision refers to and  contemplates not only proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions and acts of  executive character, but even those essentially legislative, as may be gathered  from the nature of the proclamations, decrees, orders, etc. already existing at  the time of the approval of the draft constitution and of the acceptance  thereof by the people. Accordingly, and  because there is no doubt that Proclamation 1081 and General Order No. 2,  herein challenged, are among the proclamations and orders contemplated in said  provision, the Court has no alternative but to hold, as it hereby holds, in  consonance with the authoritative construction by the Constitutional Convention  of the fundamental law of the land, that Proclamation 1081 of President Marcos  placing the Philippines under martial law as well as General Order No. 2,  pursuant to which petitioners are either in custody or restrained of their  freedoms ""until otherwise so ordered by (the President) or (his) duly  designated representative"" are valid, legal, binding and effective, and  consequently, the continued detention of petitioner Aquino as well as the  constraints on the freedoms of the other petitioners resulting from the  conditions under which they were released from custody are legal and  constitutional. We feel We are confirmed  in this conclusion by the results of the referendum of July 27-28, 1973 in which 18,052,016 voters gave  their affirmative approval to the following question: ""Under the constitution the President, if he so desires, can  continue in office beyond 1973. Do you want President Marcos to continue beyond 1973 and finish the  reforms he has initiated under Martial Law?"" We hasten to add, to avoid misunderstanding or confusion of  concepts, that it is not because of the fiat or force of the New Constitution  itself that the transitory provision is being relied upon for the purposes of  the instant petitions. At this point,  and without prejudice to looking into the matter insofar as other issues and  other cases affecting martial law and the order issued under it are concerned,  all that We say is that the said provision constitutes an authoritative  contemporary construction of the martial law clause of the Constitution giving  light regarding the emergency powers that the Executive may exercise after its  proclamation. — B — But petitioner Diokno 17 would dillute the force of this  conclusion by trying to find fault with the dispositive portion of the decision  of this Court in the Ratification Cases. He contends that actually, six justices rendered opinions expressly  holding that the New Constitution has not been validly ratified in accordance  with Article XV of the 1935 Constitution and that the said dispositive, portion  ""is not consistent with their findings, which were also the findings of  the majority of the Court."" Otherwise stated, the position of petitioner  Diokno is that the decision in the Ratification Cases has no binding legal  force as regards the question of whether or not the New Constitution is indeed  in force and effect. This is practically  an attempt to make the Court resolve the same points which counsels for the  petitioners in the Ratification Cases submitted to the Court on the last day  for the finality of the decision therein, but without asking for either the  reconsideration or modification thereof, because they merely wanted to record  for posterity their own construction of the judgment of the Court. 18 Without in any way attempting to reopen the issues already  resolved by the Court in that decision, but for the sake of erasing any doubt  as to the true import of Our judgment therein, and in order that those who  would peruse the same may not be led astray by counsel's misconstruction  thereof, the writer feels it is here opportune to say a few words relative to  petitioner's observations, considering specially that Our discussion above is  predicated on the premise that the New Constitution is in full force and  effect. To start with, it is evident that the phrase in question saying  that ""there is no further judicial obstacle to the New Constitution being  considered in force and effect"" was in actual fact approved specifically  by the members of the Court as the juridical result of their variant separate  opinions. In fact, even those who dissented,  except Justice Zaldivar, accepted by their silence the accuracy of said  conclusion. 19 Had any of the other justices, particularly, Chief Justice Makalintal and  Justice Castro felt that their joint opinion did not justify such a judgment  they would have certainly objected to its tenor, as Justice Zaldivar did. (See footnote 11). Surely, it is not for anyone to say now that  the Court misstated its judgment. In the particular case of Counsels Tañada and Arroyo, while it is  true that on the last day for the finality of that decision, they filed a  ""Constancia"", separately from the Manifestation to the same effect of  the other counsel, discussing extensively the alleged inconsistency between the  collective result of the opinions of the majority of the Court and the  dispositive portion of the judgment, like the other counsel, however, they did  not make any prayer for relief, stating that their only purpose is ""to  save our people from being misled and confused, in order to place things in  their proper perspective, and in order to keep faith with the 1935 Constitution  . . . so that when history passes judgment upon the real worth and meaning of  the historic Resolution of this Honorable Court promulgated on March 31, 1973,  it may have all the facts before it,"" for which reason, the majority of  the Court, over the dissent of Justices Zaldivar, Antonio, Esguerra and the  writer, did not consider it necessary to act, believing it was not exactly the  occasion to disabuse the minds of counsels about the judicial integrity of the  Court's actuation embodied in the resolution. In a sense, therefore, said counsels should be deemed to be in estoppel  to raise the same points now as arguments for any affirmative relief, something  which they did not ask for when it was more appropriate to do so. In the second place, laying aside the division of views among the  members of the Court on the question of whether or not there has been  compliance with the provisions of Article XV of the 1935 Constitution, the  vital and decisive fact is that the majority of the Court held that the  question of whether or not the New Constitution is already in force and effect  is a political question and the Court must perforce defer to the judgment of  the political departments of the government or of the people in that  respect. It is true some of the Justices  could not find sufficient basis for determining whether or not the people have  accepted the New Constitution, but, on that point, four Justices, Justices  Makasiar, Antonio, Esguerra and the writer, did vote categorically in the  affirmative, while two Justices, then Chief Justice Concepcion and Justice  Zaldivar, voted in the negative. And in  the joint opinion of now Chief Justice Makalintal and Justice Castro, it is  crystal clear that the reference therein to their inability to accurately  appraise the people's verdict was merely casual, the thrust of their position  being that what is decisive is the President's own attitude regarding the  situation, that is, whether he would take the report of the Katipunan ng mga  Barangay to the effect that the people have approved and ratified the New  Constitution as definitive and final or he would prefer to submit the new  charter to the same kind of election which used to be held for the ratification  of constitutional amendments, his decision either way not being subject to  judicial inquiry. Stated differently,  our distinguished colleagues were of the view that whether or not the New  Constitution may be held to have been duly ratified pursuant to Article XV of  the 1935 Constitution and even their own negative conclusion in such respect,  have no bearing on the issue of the enforceability of the New Constitution on  the basis of its having been accepted by the people, and that although they  were not possessed of sufficient knowledge to determine this particular fact,  the President's own finding thereon is conclusive upon the Court, since,  according to them, such a decision is political and outside the pale of  judicial review. To quote their own  words: ""However, a finding that the ratification of the draft  Constitution by the Citizens Assemblies, as certified by the President in  Proclamation No. 1102, was not in accordance with the constitutional and  statutory procedure laid down for the purpose does not quite resolve the questions  raised in these cases. Such a finding,  in our opinion, is not a matter which is essentially justiciable, that is,  within the power of this Court to inquire into. It imports nothing more than a simple reading and application of the  pertinent provisions of the 1935 Constitution, of the Election Code and of  other related laws and official acts. No  question of wisdom or of policy is involved. But from this finding it does not necessarily follow that this Court may  justifiably declare that the Constitution has not become effective, and for  that reason give due course to these petitions or grant the writs herein prayed  for. The effectivity of the Constitution  in the final analysis, is the basic and ultimate question posed by these cases,  to resolve which considerations other than judicial, and therefore beyond the  competence of this Court, are relevant and unavoidable. xxx xxx xxx ""If indeed it be accepted that the Citizens Assemblies had  ratified the 1973 Constitution and that such ratification as well as the  establishment of the government thereunder formed part of a revolution, albeit  peaceful, then the issue of whether or not that Constitution has become  effective and, as a necessary corollary, whether or not the government  legitimately functions under it instead of under the 1935 Constitution, is  political and therefore non-judicial in nature. Under such a postulate what the people did in the Citizens Assemblies  should be taken as an exercise of the ultimate sovereign power. If they had risen up in arms and by force  deposed the then existing government and set up a new government in its place,  there could not be the least doubt that their act would be political and not  subject to judicial review but only to the judgment of the same body politic  that is the people. This concept of what  is a political act, in the context just set forth, is based on realities. If a new government gains authority and  dominance through force, it can be effectively challenged only by a stronger  force; no judicial dictum can prevail against it. We do not see that the situation would be any  different, as far as the doctrine of judicial review is concerned, if no force  had been resorted to and the people, in defiance of the existing Constitution  but peacefully because of the absence of any appreciable opposition, ordained a  new Constitution and succeeded in having the government operate under it. Against such a reality there can be no  adequate judicial relief; and so courts forbear to take cognizance of the  question but leave it to be decided through political means. xxx xxx xxx ""But then the President, pursuant to such recommendation, did  proclaim that the Constitution had been ratified and had come into effect. The more relevant consideration, therefore,  as far as we can see, should be as to what the President had in mind in  convening the Citizens Assemblies, submitting the Constitution to them and  proclaiming that the favorable expression of their view was an act of  ratification. In this respect subjective factors, which defy judicial analysis  and adjudication, are necessarily involved. ""In positing the problem within an identifiable frame of  reference we find no need to consider whether or not the regime established by  President Marcos since he declared martial law and under which the new  Constitution was submitted to the Citizens Assemblies was a revolutionary  one. The pivotal question is rather  whether or not the effectivity of the said Constitution by virtue of  Presidential Proclamation No. 1102, upon the recommendation of the Katipunan ng  mga Barangay, was intended to be definite and irrevocable, regardless of  non-compliance with the pertinent constitutional and statutory provisions  prescribing the procedure for ratification. We must confess that after considering all the available evidence and  all the relevant circumstances we have found no reasonably reliable answer to  the question. xxx xxx xxx ""In the light of this seeming ambivalence, the choice of what  course of action to pursue belongs to the President. We have earlier made reference to subjective  factors on which this Court, to our mind, is in no position to pass  judgment. Among them is the President's  own assessment of the will of the people as expressed through the Citizens  Assemblies and of the importance of the 1973 Constitution to the successful  implementation of the social and economic reforms he has started or  envisioned. If he should decide that  there is no turning back, that what the people recommended through the Citizens  Assemblies, as they were reported to him, demanded that the action he took  pursuant thereto be final and irrevocable, then judicial review is out of the  question. “In articulating our view that the procedure of ratification that  was followed was not in accordance with the 1935 Constitution and related  statutes, we have discharged our sworn duty as we conceive it to be. The President should now perhaps decide, if  he has not already decided, whether adherence to such procedure is weighty  enough a consideration, if only to dispel any cloud of doubt that may now and  in the future shroud the nation's Charter. ""In the deliberation of this Court one of the issues  formulated for resolution is whether or not the new Constitution, since its  submission to the Citizens Assemblies, has found acceptance among the people,  such issue being related to the political question theory propounded by the  respondents. We have not tarried on the  point at all since we find no reliable basis on which to form a judgment. Under a regime of martial law, with the free  expression of opinions through the usual media vehicles restricted, we have no  means of knowing, to the point of judicial certainty, whether the people have  accepted the Constitution. In any event,  we do not find the issue decisive insofar as our vote in these cases is  concerned. To interpret the Constitution  — that is judicial. That the  Constitution should be deemed in effect because of popular acquiescence -- that  is political, and therefore beyond the domain of judicial review."" ( Javellana  vs. The Executive Secretary — 50 SCRA 161-162; 164; 166-167; 170-171) 20 It only remains for the writer to reiterate here a few  considerations already touched in the separate opinions in the Ratification  Cases which in his considered view may well be taken into account by those who  would read again the judgment of the Court therein. -1- Having come to the conclusion that the question of whether or not  the New Constitution is legally in force and effect is political and outside  the domain of judicial review, it was not strange that the Court should simply  rule that there should be no further judicial obstacle to the enforcement of  the charter, should that be, as it appeared to be, the intent of those actually  in authority in the government. It is  implicit in the political-question doctrine that the Court's opinion as to the  correctness of the legal postures involved is of no moment, for the simple  reason that the remedy against any error therein lies either with the sovereign  people at the polls or with the political department concerned in the discharge  of its own responsibility under the fundamental law of the land, and not with  the Court. Even if it were otherwise  desirable, if only for the benefit of those interested in the settlement of the  specific legal problem posed, any categorical ruling thereon would transcend  the bounds of judicial propriety. For  the Court to hold it is without power to decide and in the same breath to  actually decide is an intolerable incongruity, hence any pronouncement or  holding made under the circumstances could have no more force that an obiter  dictum, no matter how rich in erudition and precedential support. Consequently, to say that the New  Constitution may be considered by those in authority to be in force and effect  because such is the mandate expressed by the people in the form announced by  the President is but a proper manner of expressing the Court's abstention from  wresting the power to decide from those in whom such prerogative is  constitutionally lodged. This is neither  to dodge a constitutional duty nor to refrain from getting involved in a  controversy of transcendental implications — it is plain adherence to a  principle considered paramount in republican democracies wherein the  political-question doctrine is deeply imbedded as an inextricable part of the  rule of law. It is an unpardonable  misconception of the doctrine for anyone to believe that for the Supreme Court  to bow to the perceptible or audible voice of the sovereign people in  appropriate instances is in any sense a departure from or a disregard of law as  applied to political situations, for the very rule that enjoins judicial  interference in political questions is no less a legal principle than any other  that can be conceived. Indeed, just as,  in law, judicial decisions rendered within the ambit of the courts' authority  deserve the respect of the people, by the same token, the people's verdict on  what inherently is theirs to decide must be accorded due deference by the  judiciary. Otherwise, judges would be  more powerful than the people by whom they have been given no more prerogative  than to act solely within the boundaries of the judicial sphere. Withal, a court may err in finding that a  given situation calls for its abstention, in the same way it may commit  mistakes of judgment about any other matter it decides, still its decision,  conceding its honesty, cannot be faulted as an assault on the rule of law. Thus, in a broad sense, it may be said that  it is a necessary corollary of the truth that the administration of justice in courts  presided by human beings cannot be perfect that even the honest mistake of a  judge is a law. The writer further submits that, as pointed out in his separate  opinion in the Ratification Cases, those who vehemently insist that the  referendum of January 10-15, 1973 was not the kind of election contemplated in  Article XV of the 1935 Constitution seem to overlook that the said provision  refers only to the mode of ratifying amendments thereto and makes no mention at  all of how a new constitution designed to supersede it is to be submitted for  approval by the people. Indeed, the  writer would readily agree, as was already made clear in the aforementioned  opinion, that if what were submitted to the people in the January, 1973  referendum had been merely an amendment or a bundle of amendments to the 1935  Constitution, the results thereof could not constitute a valid ratification  thereof. But since it was a whole  integral charter that the Citizens' Assemblies had before them in that  referendum, it is evident that the ratification clause invoked cannot be  controlling. That a new constitution is not contemplated is indicated in the  text of the provision itself. It  says: ""Such amendments shall be  valid as part of this Constitution when approved by a majority of the votes  cast . . . .” How can it be ever conceived that the 1973 Constitution which is  an entire charter in itself, differing substantially in its entirety and  radically in most of its provisions, from the 1935 Constitution be part of the  latter? In other words, the mode of  ratification prescribed in Article XV is only for amendments that can be made  part of the whole constitution, obviously not to an entire charter precisely  purported to supersede it. And it is but logical that a constitution cannot and should not  attempt to bind future generations as to how they would do away with it in  favor of one suitable to their more recent needs and aspirations. It is true that in Tolentino vs. Comelec ,  41 SCRA 702, this Court, thru the writer, held that: ""In our discussion of the issue of jurisdiction, We have  already made it clear that the Convention came into being by a call of a joint  session of Congress pursuant to Section 1 of Article XV of the Constitution,  already quoted earlier in this opinion. We reiterate also that as to matters not related to its internal  operation and the performance of its assigned mission to propose amendments to  the Constitution, the Convention and its officers and members are all subject  to all the provisions of the existing Constitution. Now, We hold that even as to its latter task  of proposing amendments to the Constitution, it is subject to the provisions of  Section 1 of Article XV. This must be  so, because it is plain to Us that the framers of the Constitution took care  that the process of amending the same should not be undertaken with the same  ease and facility in changing an ordinary legislation. Constitution making is the most valued power,  second to none, of the people in a constitutional democracy such as the one our  founding fathers have chosen for this nation, and which we of the succeeding  generations generally cherish. And  because the Constitution affects the lives, fortunes, future and every other  conceivable aspect of the lives of all the people within the country and those  subject to its sovereignty, every degree of care is taken in preparing and  drafting it. A constitution worthy of  the people for which it is intended must not be prepared in haste without  adequate deliberation and study. It is  obvious that correspondingly, any amendment of the Constitution itself, must  perforce be conceived and prepared with as much care and deliberation. From the very nature of things, the drafters  of an original constitution, as already observed earlier, operate without any  limitations, restraints or inhibitions save those that they may impose upon  themselves. This is not necessarily true  of subsequent conventions called to amend the original constitution. Generally, the framers of the latter see to  it that their handiwork is not lightly treated and as easily mutilated or  changed, not only for reasons purely personal but more importantly, because  written constitutions are supposed to be designed so as to last for some time,  if not for ages, or for, at least, so long as they can be adopted to the needs  and exigencies of the people, hence, they must be insulated against precipitate  and hasty actions motivated by more or less passing political moods or  fancies. Thus, as a rule, the original  constitutions carry with them limitations and conditions, more or less  stringent, made so by the people themselves, in regard to the process of their  amendment. And when such limitations or  conditions are so incorporated in the original constitution, it does not lie in  the delegates of any subsequent convention to claim that they may ignore and  disregard such conditions because they are as powerful and omnipotent as their  original counterparts."" (At Page 724-726) But this passage should not be  understood, as it was not meant to be understood, to refer to the people's  inalienable right to cast aside the whole constitution itself when they find it  to be in their best interests to do so. It was so indicated already in the resolution denying the motion for  reconsideration: ""This is not to say that the people may not, in the exercise  of their inherent revolutionary powers, amend the Constitution or promulgate an  entirely new one otherwise, but as long as any amendment is formulated and  submitted under the aegis of the present Charter, any proposal for such  amendment which is not in conformity with the letter, spirit and intent of the  provision of the Charter for effecting amendments cannot receive the sanction  of this Court."" (Resolution of Motion for Reconsideration, Tolentino vs.  Comelec , G.R. No. L-34150, February   4, 1971 ). For it is rather absurd to think that in  approving a new fundamental law with which they would replace the existing one,  they have to adhere to the mandates of the latter, under pain of getting stuck  with it, should they fail. One can  easily visualize how the evil forces which dominated the electoral process  during the old society would have gone into play in order to stifle the urge  for change, had the mode of ratification in the manner of past plebiscites been  the one observed in the submission of the New Constitution. To reiterate what the writer said in the  Ratification Cases: ""Consider that in the present case  what is involved is not just an amendment of a particular provision of an  existing Constitution; here, it is, as I have discussed earlier above, an  entirely new Constitution that is being proposed. This important circumstance makes a great  deal of difference. No less than counsel Tolentino for herein  respondents Puyat and Roy, who was himself the petitioner in the case I have  just referred to, is now inviting Our attention to the exact language of  Article XV and suggesting that the said Article may be strictly applied to  proposed amendments but may hardly govern the ratification of a new  Constitution. It is particularly  stressed that the Article specifically refers to nothing else but  ""amendments to this Constitution"" which if ratified ""shall be  valid as part of this Constitution."" Indeed, how can a whole new  constitution be by any manner of reasoning an amendment to any other  constitution and how can it, if ratified, form part of such other constitution?  x x x ""It is not strange at all to think that the amending clause of  a constitution should be confined in its application only to proposed changes  in any part of the same constitution itself, for the very fact that a new  constitution is being adopted implies a general intent to put aside the whole  of the old one, and what would be really incongruous is the idea that in such  an eventuality, the new Constitution would subject its going into effect to any  provision of the constitution it is to supersede, to use the language precisely  of Section 6, Article XVII, the effectivity clause, of the New  Constitution. My understanding is that  generally, constitutions are selfborn, they very rarely, if at all, come into  being, by virtue of any provision of another constitution. This must be the reason why every  constitution has its own effectivity clause, so that if, the Constitutional  Convention had only anticipated the idea of the referendum and provided for  such a method to be used in the ratification of the New Constitution, I would  have had serious doubts as to whether Article XV could have had priority of  application."" ( Javellana vs. The Executive Secretary — 50 SCRA 197-198). Since in the withdrawal motion of petitioner Diokno, the whole  thrust of this posture relative to the alleged non-enforceability of the  Constitution of 1973 revolves around supposed non-compliance in its  ratification, with Article XV of the 1935 Charter, and inasmuch as it is  evident that the letter and intent of that invoked provision do not warrant, as  has just been explained, the application thereof to the New Constitution, for  the simple reason that the same is not in fact and in law as well as in form  and in intent a mere amendment to the Old Constitution, but an integrally new  charter which cannot conceivably be made just a part thereof, one cannot but  view said motion to withdraw as having been designed for no other purpose than  to serve as a vehicle for the ventilation of petitioner's political rather than  legal outlook which deserves scant consideration in the determination of the  merits of the case at bar. In any event, that a constitution need not be ratified in the  manner prescribed by its predecessor and that the possible invalidity or the  mode of its ratification does not affect its enforceability, as long as the  fact of its approval by the people or their acquiescence thereto is reasonably  shown, is amply demonstrated in the scholarly dissertation made by our learned  colleague, Mr. Justice Felix V. Makasiar, in his separate opinion in the  Ratification Cases, which carried the concurrence of Justices Antonio, Esguerra  and the writer. And that what took place  in the Philippines in January, 1973 is not an unprecedented practice peculiar  to our country, is likewise plainly shown therein, since it appears that no  less than the Constitution of the United States of America, the nation whose  close adherence to constitutionalism petitioners would want the Filipinos to  emulate, was also ratified in a way not in conformity with the Articles of  Confederation and Perpetual Union, the Constitution which it replaced, and the  reason for it was only because those in authority felt that it was impossible to  secure ratification, if the amendment clause of the Articles were to be  observed, and so they resorted to extra-constitutional means to accomplish  their purpose of having a new constitution. Following is the pertinent portion of Mr. Justice Makasiar's illuminating  disquisition based on actual historical facts rather than on theoretical and  philosophical hypotheses on which petitioners would seem to rely: ""The classic example of an illegal submission that did not  impair the validity of the ratification or adoption of a new Constitution is  the case of the Federal Constitution of the United    States . It should be recalled that the thirteen (13) original states of the  American Union — which succeeded in liberating themselves from England after  the revolution which began on April 19, 1775 with the skirmish at Lexington,  Massachusetts and ended with the surrender of General Cornwallis at Yorktown,  Virginia, on October 19, 1781 (Encyclopedia Brit., Vol. 1, 1933 Ed., p. 776) —  adopted their Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, that was written  from 1776 to 1777 and ratified on March 1, 1781 (Encyclopedia Brit., Vol. II,  1966 Ed., p. 525). About six years  thereafter, the Congress of the Confederation passed a resolution on February 21, 1787 calling for a Federal  Constitutional Convention ""for the sole and express purpose of revising  the articles of confederation . . ."" (Appendix I, The Federalist,  Modern Library ed., p. 577, italics supplied). ""The Convention convened at Philadelphia on May 14, 1787 . Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation  and Perpetual Union stated specifically: ‘The articles of this confederation shall  be inviolably observed by every state, and the union shall be perpetual; nor shall  any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such  alteration be agreed to in a congress of the united states, and be afterwards  confirmed by the legislatures of every state .’ (See the Federalist,  Appendix II, Modern Library Ed., 1937, p. 584; italics supplied). But the foregoing requirements prescribed by the Articles of  Confederation and Perpetual Union for the alteration and for the ratification  of the Federal Constitution as drafted by the Philadelphia Convention were not  followed. Fearful that the said Federal  Constitution would not be ratified by the state legislatures as prescribed, the  Philadelphia Convention adopted a resolution requesting the Congress of the  Confederation to pass a resolution providing that the Federal Constitution  should be submitted to elected state conventions and if ratified by the  conventions in nine (9) states, not necessarily in all thirteen (13) states,  the said Constitution shall take effect. Thus, history Professor Edward Earle Mead of Princeton University recorded that: 'It would have been a counsel of perfection to consign the new  Constitution to the tender mercies of the legislatures of each and all of the  13 states. Experience clearly indicated  that ratification would have had the same chance as the scriptural camel  passing thru the eye of a needle. It  was therefore determined to recommend to Congress that the new Constitution be  submitted to conventions in the several states specially elected to pass it and  when it should be ratified by nine of the thirteen states . . .’ (The  Federalist, Modern Library Ed., 1937, Introduction by Edward Earle Mead, pp.  viii-ix, italics supplied). Historian Samuel Eliot Morison similarly recounted: 'The Convention, anticipating that the influence of many state  politicians would be Antifederalist, provided for ratification of the  Constitution by popularly elected conventions in each state. Suspecting that Rhode    Island , at least, would prove recalcitrant, it  declared that the Constitution would go into effect as soon as nine states  ratified. The convention method had the  further advantage that judges, ministers, and others ineligible to state  legislatures, could be elected to a convention. The nine-state provision was, of course, mildly revolutionary. But the Congress of the Confederation, still  sitting in New York to carry on  federal government until relieved, formally submitted the new constitution to  the states and politely faded out before the first presidential inauguration.'  (The Oxford History of the Am.  People by Samuel Eliot Morison, 1965 ed., p. 312). And so the American Constitution was ratified by nine (9) states on  June 21, 1788 and by the last four states on May 29, 1790 (12 C.J. p. 679  footnote, 16 C.J.S. 27 — by the state conventions and not by all thirteen (13  state legislatures as required by Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation  and Perpetual Union aforequoted — and in spite of the fact that the Federal  Constitution as originally adopted suffers from two basic infirmities,  namely, the absence of a bill of rights and of a provision affirming the power  of judicial review. The liberties of the American people were guaranteed by the  subsequent amendments to the Federal Constitution. The doctrine of judicial review has become  part of American constitutional law only by virtue of a judicial pronouncement  by Chief Justice Marshall in the case of Marbury vs. Madison (1803, 1  Cranch 137). Until this date, no challenge has been launched against the  validity of the ratification of the American Constitution, nor against the legitimacy  of the government organized and functioning thereunder. In the 1946 case of Wheeler vs. Board of Trustees (37 SE 2nd  322, 326-330), which enunciated the  principle that the validity of a new or revised Constitution does not depend on  the method of its submission or ratification by the people, but on the fact  of fiat or approval or adoption or acquiescence by the people, which fact of  ratification or adoption or acquiescence is all that is essential, the  Court cited precisely the case of the irregular revision and ratification by  state conventions of the Federal Constitution, thus: ‘No case identical in its facts with the case now under  consideration has been called to our attention, and we have found none, We  think that the principle which we apply in the instant case was very clearly  applied in the creation of the constitution of the United    States . The convention created by a resolution of Congress had authority to do  one thing, and one only, to wit, amend the articles of confederation. This they did not do, but submitted to the  sovereign power, the people, a new constitution. In this manner was the constitution of the  United States submitted to the people and it became operative as the organic  law of this nation when it had been properly adopted by the people.' 'Pomeroy's Constitutional Law, p. 55, discussing the convention  that formulated the constitution of the United States, has this to say: ""The convention proceeded to do, and did  accomplish, what they were not authorized to do by a resolution of Congress  that called them together. That  resolution plainly contemplated amendments to the articles of confederation, to  be submitted to and passed by the Congress, and afterwards ratified by all the  state legislatures, in the manner pointed out by the existing organic law. But the convention soon became convinced that  any amendments were powerless to effect a cure; that the disease was too deeply  seated to be reached by such tentative means. They saw that the system they were called to improve must be totally  abandoned, and that the national idea must be re-established at the center of  their political society. It was objected  by some members, that they had no power, no authority, to construct a new  government. They had no authority, if  their decisions were to be final; and no authority whatever, under the articles  of confederation, to adopt the course they did. But they knew that their labors were only to be suggestions: and that  they as well as any private individuals, and any private individuals as well as  they, had a right to propose a plan of government to the people for their  adoption. They were, in fact, a mere  assemblage of private citizens, and their work had no more binding sanction,  than a constitution drafted by Mr. Hamilton in his office would have had. The people, by their expressed will,  transformed this suggestion, this proposal, into an organic law, and the people  might have done the same with a constitution submitted to them by a single citizen.' x x x x x x x x x ‘x x x When the people adopt a completely revised or new  Constitution, the framing or submission of the instrument is not what gives it  binding force and effect. The fiat of  the people, and only the fiat of the people, can breathe life into a  constitution. ‘ x x x We do not hesitate to say that a court is never justified  in placing by implication a limitation upon the sovereign. This would be an unauthorized exercise of  sovereign power by the court. (In State vs. Swift, 69 Ind. 505, 519,  the Indiana Supreme Court said: 'The  people of a State may form an original constitution, or abrogate an old one and  form a new one, at any time, without any political restriction except the  constitution of the United States; . . .' (37 SE 327-328, 329, italics  supplied.) In the 1903 case of Weston vs. Ryan , the Court held: ‘It remains to be said that if we felt at liberty to pass  upon this question, and were compelled to hold that the act of February 23,  1887, is unconstitutional and void, it would not, in our opinion, by any  means follow that the amendment is not a part of our state Constitution. In the recent case of Taylor vs .  Commonwealth (Va.) 44 S.E. 754, the Supreme Court of Virginia held that  their state Constitution of 1902, having been acknowledged and accepted by the  officers administering the state government, and by the people, and being in  force without opposition, must be regarded as an existing Constitution,  irrespective of the question as to whether or not the convention which  promulgated it had authority so to do without submitting it to a vote of the  people. In Brittle vs. People,  2 Neb. 198, is a similar holding as to certain provisions of the Nebraska  Constitution of 1886, which were added by the Legislature at the requirement of  Congress, though never submitted to the people for their approval.' (97 NW 349-350;  italics supplied). Against the decision in the Wheeler case, supra, confirming the  validity of the ratification and adoption of the American Constitution, in  spite of the fact that such ratification was a clear violation of the  prescription on alteration and ratification of the Articles of Confederation  and Perpetual Union, petitioners in G.R. No. L-36165 dismissed this most  significant historical fact by calling the Federal Constitution of the United  States as a revolutionary one, invoking the opinion expressed in Vol. 16,  Corpus Juris Secundum, p. 27, that it was a revolutionary constitution because  it did not obey the requirement that the Articles of Confederation and  Perpetual Union can be amended only with the consent of all thirteen (13) state  legislatures. This opinion does not cite  any decided case, but merely refers of the footnotes on the brief historical  account of the United States Constitution on p. 679 of Vol. 12, CJS. Petitioners, on p. 18 of their main Notes,  refer US to pp. 270-316 of the Oxford History of the American People, 1965  Ed. by Samuel Eliot Morison, who discusses the Articles of Confederation and  Perpetual Union in Chapter XVIII captioned `Revolutionary Constitution Making,  1775 1781' (pp. 270-281). In Chapter XX  on 'The Creative Period in Politics, 1785-1788,' Professor Morison delineates  the genesis of the Federal Constitution, but does not refer to it even  implicitly as a revolutionary constitution (pp. 297-316). However, the Federal Constitution may be  considered revolutionary from the view point of McIver if the term revolution is understood in 'its WIDER sense to embrace decisive changes in the  character of government, even though they do not involve the violent  overthrow of an established order, xx.' (R.M. Maclver, The Web of Government,  1965 ed., p. 203). It is rather ridiculous to refer to the American Constitution as a  revolutionary constitution. The Articles  of Confederation and Perpetual Union that was in force from July 12, 1776 to 1788, forged as it  was during the war of independence was a revolutionary constitution of the  thirteen (13) states. In the existing  Federal Constitution of the United States which was adopted seven (7) or nine (9)  years after the thirteen (13) states won their independence and long after  popular support for the government of the Confederation had stabilized was not  a product of a revolution. The Federal  Constitution was a 'creation of the brain and purpose of man' in an era of  peace. It can only be considered  revolutionary in the sense that it is a radical departure from its predecessor,  the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. It is equally absurd to affirm that the present Federal  Constitution of the United States is not the successor to the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. The fallacy of the statement is so obvious  that no further refutation is needed."" (50 SCRA 209-215). Moreover, whether a proposal submitted to the people is just an  amendment to an existing constitution within the contemplation of its amendment  clause or is a new charter not comprehended by its language may not be  determined solely by the simple processes of analysis of and comparison between  the contents of one and the other. Very  much depends on what the constituent assembly, reflecting its understanding of  the desire of the people it represents, actually intends its handiwork to be,  as such intent may be duduced from the face of the document itself. For the truth is that whatever changes in  form and in substance a constitution may undergo, as long as the same  political, social and economic ideologies as before continue to be the  motivation behind such changes, the result can never be, in a strict sense, a  new constitution at all. Indeed, in such  circumstance, any alteration or modification of any provision of a  constitution, no matter how extensive, can always be traced as founded on its  own bedrock, thereby proving identity. It is therefore the expressed desire of the makers of the charter that  is decisive. And that is why the New  Constitution has its own effectivity clause which makes no reference howsoever  to Article XV of the past charter. 21 Now, how the founding fathers of America must have regarded the  difference between a constitutional amendment, on the one hand, and a new  Constitution, on the other, when they found the Articles of Confederation and  Perpetual Union no longer adequate for the full development of their nation, as  can be deduced from the historical account above, is at least one case in point  — they exercised their right to ratify their new fundamental law in the most  feasible manner, without regard to any constitutional constraints. And yet, it is the constitution that is reputed  to have stood all tests and was, in fact, the model of many national  constitutions, including our own of 1935, if it cannot be accurately regarded  also as the model of the present one. With the foregoing considerations in mind, it can be readily seen  how pointless it is to contend, as petitioner Diokno does in his motion to  withdraw, that what he deems as the failure of the January, 1973 referendum to  conform with the requirements of Article XV of the 1935 Constitution detracts  from the enforceability of the New Constitution, in the light of the  President's assertion contained in Proclamation 1102 that it has been approved  and ratified by the people, coupled with his evident firm and irreversible  resolution to consider it to have been, indeed, duly ratified, and in the face  of the indisputable fact that the whole government effectively in control of  the entire Philippine territory has been operating under it without any visible  resistance on the part any significant sector of the populace. To allude to the filing of the petitions in  the Plebiscite and the Ratification Cases and the occasional appearances in  some public places of some underground propaganda which, anyway, has not cut  any perceptible impression anywhere, as indicative or evidence of opposition by  the people to the New Constitution would be, to use a commonplace but apt  expression, to mistake the trees for the forest. It is thus abundantly clear that the passionate and tenacious ratiocination  in petitioner Diokno's withdrawal motion tending to assail the cogency of our  opinions and their consistency with the judgment in the Ratification Cases, to  the extent of using terms that could signify doubt in the good faith and  intellectual integrity of some members of the Court and of trying to embarrass  the Court itself before the bar of history, does not in fact have any plausible  basis whatsoever. C O N C L U S I O N The instant cases are unique. To Our knowledge never before has any national tribunal of the highest  authority been called upon to pass on the validity of a martial law order of  the Executive issued in the face of actual or imminent danger of a rebellion —  threatening the very existence of the nation. The petitions herein treat of no more than the deprivation of liberty of  the petitioners, but in reality what is involved here is the legitimacy of the  government itself. No Supreme Court of  any other country in the world, We reiterate, has even been confronted with  such a transcendental issue. This is, therefore, a decision that affects not the petitioners  alone, but the whole country and all our people. For this reason, We have endeavored to the  best of our ability to look at all the issues from every conceivable point of  view. We have gone over all the  jurisprudence cited by the parties, the writings of learned and knowledgeable  authorities they have quoted and whatever We could avail of by Ourselves. We trust We have not misunderstood any of the  contentions of the parties and their able and learned counsels and that We have  not overlooked any authority relevant to them. And We must say We perceive no cause to  downgrade their love of and loyalty to our common motherland even if  differences there are between our convictions as to how to earlier attain the  national destiny. Indeed, We have not  considered as really persuasive any insinuations of motivations born of  political partisanship and personal ambitions. We do not mean to belittle or depreciate foreign jurisprudence,  but We have deliberately refrained from relying on alien opinions, judicial or  otherwise, in order to stress that the Filipinos can solve their own problems  with their own resources intellectual or otherwise. Anyway, We doubt if there is enough relevant  parallelism between occurrences in other countries passed upon by the courts  with what is happening here today. Principally, by this decision, We hold that the power to proclaim  martial law is lodged by the Constitution exclusively in the Executive, but the  grant of judicial power to the Supreme Court also by the Constitution is  plenary and total and, therefore, when it is a matter of judicial notice,  because it is commonly known by the general public or is capable of  unquestionable demonstration, that any particular declaration of martial law is  devoid of any of the constitutionally required bases, the Court has the full  authority and it would not hesitate to strike down any such improvident  proclamation and to adjudge that the legitimate government continue without the  offending Executive, who shall be replaced in accordance with the rules of  succession provided in the existing Constitution and laws. In the cases at bar, however, the Court, with  the abstention of only one member who has preferred not to emit any opinion on  the issue at this time, holds that the President had good and sufficient  grounds in issuing Proclamation 1081, whether the same is examined in the light  of its own recitals, as some Justices advocate, or of facts of judicial notice  together with those undisputed in the record, in the manner the rest of Us have  actually tested it. We further hold that  in restraining the liberties of petitioners, the President has not overstepped  the boundaries fixed by the Constitution. For doctrinal purposes, it is best to add to all the foregoing  that a judicial challenge against the imposition of martial law by the  Executive in the midst of the actualities of a real assault against the  territorial integrity and life of the nation, inevitably calls for the  reconciliation, which We feel We have been able to effectuate here, of two  extremes in the allocation of powers under the Constitution — the resort by the  Executive to the ultimate weapon with which the fundamental law allows him to  defend the state against factual invasion or rebellion threatening the public  safety, on the one hand, and the assertion by the Supreme Court of the  irreducible plenitude of its judicial authority, on the other. No other conflict of prerogatives of such  total dimensions can conceivably arise from the operation of any other two  parts of the charter. This decision then  could well be sui generis, hence, whatever has been said here  would not necessarily govern questions related to adverse claims of authority  related to the lower levels of the hierarchy of powers in the Constitution. We humbly submit this decision to the judgment of all our people,  to history and to the generations of Filipinos still unborn, confident that it  carries all that We know and all that We are. As We do this, We are fully aware that in this critical stage of our life  as a nation, our overriding need is unity. It is Our fervent hope that by this decision, We have duly performed Our  constitutionally assigned part in the great effort to reduce if not to  eliminate the remaining fundamental causes of internecine strife. May Divine Providence continue to always keep the Philippines in the right paths of democracy, freedom and justice for all! J U D G M E N T WHEREFORE , the petitions in all the above-entitled cases  are dismissed. No costs. A D D E N D U M The following are my reasons for voting in favor of granting the  motion to withdraw: It is elementary that the remedy of habeas corpus exists  only against involuntary confinement. The moment, therefore, that after initially questioning the legality of  his detention, the petitioner seeks withdrawal of his petition at any stage of  the case before judgment, his detention becomes in law automatically, by his  own act, voluntary or with his express consent, hence, the reason for further  inquiry into the circumstances thereof ceases completely, and the court's duty  to proceed further and render judgment comes to an end. By allowing the withdrawal, no interest of  justice would be prejudiced, no juridical harm needing redress could be caused  to anyone. Accordingly, the petitioner's  motive for his withdrawal, whether expressed or unarticulated, are absolutely  immaterial, albeit, in the case at bar, petitioner himself suggests that, while  acceding to his request, the members of the Court may express their views  thereon. (Sur-Rejoinder dated May 21,  1974, p. 3). In the mind of the writer, the grounds alleged by petitioner  Diokno and his counsel have an apparent tendency to offend the dignity of the  Court and to undermine the respect and faith of the people in its capacity to  administer justice. What is worse, they  may be false and baseless, as they are emotional and personal. Unless properly explained, they give the  impression that movant is impeaching the integrity and good faith of some  members of the Court. In the premises,  said petitioner and counsel could be required to show cause why they should not  be held in contempt of the Court, but there being no formal charge to such  effect in the instant proceedings, and in order not to confuse the discussion  and resolution of the transcendental issues herein, it is preferable, and the  Court has opted, to take up the matter of the possible responsibility for  contempt separately, either motu propio or upon the initiative of  whoever may allege to be aggrieved thereby. For the present, it has to be stated, however, that under no circumstances  may any party or counsel vent his personal feelings and emotions in any  pleading or paper filed with the Court, particularly while his case is pending  therein. Personalities that are directed  towards the occupants of the judicial office naturally mar the legal issues  before them, correspondingly making more difficult their proper and impartial  resolution. Even if the judges concerned  are actually, as they are supposed to be, unmoved by them, still there can be  no assurance that the litigants and the public in general will be convinced of  their absolute impartiality in their subsequent actuations, and to that extent,  the interests of justice are bound to suffer. It is but in keeping with the highest traditions of the judiciary that  such improprieties are not allowed to pass unnoticed and are dealt with by the  court either motu propio or upon corresponding complaint, whether in and  independent proceeding or as an incident within the pending case. No court worthy of its position should  tolerate them. But assaults upon the dignity and integrity of the court, are one  thing, and the issues of the case at hand are another. Regardless of what the judge thinks is the  belief of those concerned about the motivations of the court's subsequent  resolution of the issues, unless he inhibits himself from further acting in the  case, circumstances permitting, it is his inescapable duty to render judgment,  taking care, of course, that he remains, in fact, objective and impartial. It is, therefore, of no moment, for the  purposes of disposing of petitioner Diokno's motion to withdraw, whether or not  the charges leveled by him and his counsel against the Court or any of its  members are founded or unfounded and whether or not the same constitute  actionable misconduct on their part, as participants in the case before Us  and/or as members of the Bar and officers of the Court. Any possible action for such probable  misconduct has no bearing on the question of whether or not, observing the  usual rules and practices, the Court should dismiss his main petition, the  alleged illegality of his detention having been duly cured by his voluntary  submission thereto. All these is not to say that I have not given thought to the  imperative necessity of resolving the issues of public interest raised in  petitioner Diokno's petition. I can also  see that it is important to the Government that he does not escape the legal  effect of the decision in these cases. But if these are the main reasons for denying his motion to withdraw, I  believe that the Government's apprehensions are rather unfounded. While I would not say that by his withdrawal,  petitioner impliedly admits the correctness of the stand of the Government,  what with the avalanche of protests against alleged injustice and supposed  legal errors running through his pleadings, I am of the considered view that in  law, he cannot correctly pretend that the rulings of the Court in the other  cases herein in respect to the issues therein that are common with those of his  petition are not binding on him at least by precedential force. And inasmuch as in the cases not withdrawn,  all the issues of public interest raised in his case will have to be resolved,  I do not see any purpose in insisting that he should remain a petitioner when  he refuses, as a matter of conscience, to await the unfavorable verdict he  foresees in his own case, which he himself anticipates will not set him free  anyway. Of course, he protests that  nothing he can say can convince the Court, and, on the other hand, perhaps, the  most technically accurate and palpably just decision the court may fashion will  not convince him, but it has to be a strange court that will yield to a  litigant's point of view just because he sincerely feels he is right, whereas  it is not unusual for a litigant to pretend not to see the correctness and  justice of the court's judgment unfavorable to his interests. (a) 50 SCRA 30. [1] The Court took no action on the prohibition aspect of G.R. No. L-35540 and  later of G.R. No. L-35573. Anyway, with  the outcome of the habeas corpus petitions and in the light of the  grounds of this decision, it would be academic to prosecute the same further. [2] Petitioner died at ABM Sison Hospital on March 2, 1973 of causes unrelated to his  detention. [3] Actually there are only 28 petitioners, as 4 of them appear to have filed  double petitions. [4] Excluding Enrique Voltaire Garcia II who, as mentioned earlier, had died. [5] The writer's reasons in favor of granting the motion to withdraw are discussed in  the addendum to this decision. Since the  Court as a body has denied said motion, petitioner Diokno's case has to be  resolved on its merits. Accordingly, a  discussion of some of the grounds alleged in the said motion which may have a  bearing in one way of another with the fundamental issues herein involved is in  order. In view, however, of the release  of Senator Diokno on September 11 1974 ,  the Court has decided to dismiss his petition for being moot and academic. But this development does not necessarily  render the discussion of his contentions irrelevant because they can also  support the cases of the other petitioner, hence it seems better to retain said  discussion in this opinion. [6] At best, such a pose could be true only as regards his arrest and detention up  to January 17, 1973 , but  not with respect to his continued detention after the New Constitution became  effective. 6a Villavicencio vs . Lukban, 39  Phil. 778, at p. 790. 7 It is a matter of contemporary history that in a unanimous decision promulgated  on January 8, 1973 , in the  case of Sergio Osmena, Jr. vs . Ferdinand E. Marcos, the Presidential  Electoral Tribunal upheld the election of President Marcos in November, 1969  and dismissed the protest of Osmena, ruling as follows: “In the light of the foregoing, We  are of the opinion and so hold that the result of the revision and appreciation  of the ballots in the pilot provinces, congressional districts and cities  designated by the Protestant as best exemplifying the rampant terrorism and  massive vote-buying, as well as the fraud and other irregularities allegedly  committed by the Protestee, has shown, beyond doubt, that the latter had  obtained a very substantial plurality and/or majority of votes over the  former, regardless of whether We consider that the Protest is limited to the  elections in the provinces, congressional districts and cities specified in  paragraph VIII of the Protest, or includes, also, the result of the elections  in the provinces and municipalities mentioned in paragraph VII of the Protest,  or even if the average reductions suffered by both parties in said pilot  provinces, congressional districts and cities were applied to the entire  Philippines; that it is unnecessary, therefore, to continue the present  proceedings and revise the ballots cast in the provinces and cities specified  in paragraph VIII of the Protest — much less those named in paragraph VII  thereof —other than the pilot provinces and congressional districts designated  by the Protestant, as above-stated; that neither would it serve any useful  purpose to revise the ballots cast in the provinces and cities  counter-protested by the Protestee herein; that, in filing his certificate of  candidacy - for Mayor of Cebu City, in the general elections held in 1971, and  particularly, in assuming said office on January 1, 1972, (as attested to by  his oath of office, copy of which is appended to this decision as Annex H)  after his proclamation as the candidate elected to said office, the Protestant  had abandoned his Protest herein: that the  Protestant has failed to make out his case; that the Protestee has obtained the  plurality and majority of the votes cast for the office of the President of the  Philippines, in the general elections held in 1969; and that, accordingly, he  was duly elected to said office in the aforementioned elections and properly  proclaimed as such.” 8 Excluding week-end suspension of sessions.. * See footnote on page 143. 9 Unless expressly stated otherwise, all references to  the Constitution in this discussion are to both the 1935 and 1973 charters,  since, after all the pertinent provisions are practically identical in both. 10 See provisions of both the Old and the New  Constitution infra, quoted on page 103.

Castillo, 4 SCRA 1. 16 In the referendum of January 10-15, 1973 , the people expressed themselves  against the holding of elections and the immediate convening of the  legislature. This was virtually  reaffirmed in the referemdum of July   27-28, 1973 . 17 It is interesting to note that the other  petitioners have not discussed this issue and do not seemingly join him in his  pose. 18 Which may not be surprising, considering that  Counsel Tañada of petitioner Diokno who signed the motion to withdraw was one  of the leading counsels of the petitioners in the Ratification Cases. 19 In G.R. No. L-36142, Javellana vs . Executive  Secretary and the other Ratification Cases, the writer, joined by Justices  Antonio and Esguerra, was of the view that before allowing the entry of final  judgment and despite the absence of any prayer for relief in the Constancia and  Manifestation mentioned above, it was best for the Court to correct the  representation of counsel regarding the true juridical import of the decision,  but the majority were of the opinion that misconstructions by the interested  parties of the judgment of the Court cannot alter the effect thereof intended  by the Court and evident in its dispositive portion. The writer was afraid that future occasions  might arise, as it has happened now, when Our silence may be taken advantage  of, even for the sake of propaganda alone. On the other hand, Justice Zaldivar stated that ""I find merit in  the 'Constancia' and manifestation of counsel for the petitioners where they  assert that the sentence. 'This being  the vote of the majority, there is no further judicial obstacle to the New  Constitution being considered in force and effect in the dispositive portion of  the resolution is not warranted . . ."" and that ""This last sentence  of the dispositive portion of the resolution should have been deleted."" 20 The above exposition of the joint opinion is made  in order to explain why the rest of the members of the Court (except Justice  Zaldivar) evidently felt that the view thus expressed by Chief Justice  Makalintal and Justice Castro justified not only the judgment of dismissal but  also the statement that ""there is no more judicial obstacle to the New  Constitution being considered in force and effect."" 21 Section 16 of Article XVII of the 1973 Constitution  provides: ""This Constitution shall  take effect immediately upon its ratification by a majority of the votes cast  in a plebiscite called for the purpose and, except as herein provided, shall  supersede the Constitution of nineteen hundred and thirty-five and all  amendments thereto."" Even this expressed desire of the Convention was  disregarded by the people, and it is difficult to see what valid principle  there is that can curtail them from exercising their ultimate sovereign  authority in the manner they deem best under the circumstances. SEPARATE OPINION CASTRO, J. : I These nine cases are applications for writs of habeas corpus . The petitions aver in substance that on  September 21, 1972 the President of the Philippines placed the country under  martial law (Proclamation 1081); that on various dates from September 22 to  September 30, 1972, the petitioners or the persons in whose behalf the  applications were made were arrested by the military authorities and detained,  some at Fort Bonifacio in Makati , Rizal , others at Camp Aguinaldo and still others at Camp Crame , both in Quezon City; and that the arrest and detention of the  petitioners were illegal, having been effected without a valid order of a  competent court of justice. Writs of habeas corpus were issued by the Court directing  the respondents Secretary of National Defense, Chief of Staff of the Armed  Forces of the Philippines ,  and Chief of the Philippine Constabulary, to produce the bodies of the  petitioners in Court on designated dates and to make returns to the writs. In due time the respondents, through the  Solicitor General, filed their returns to the writs and answers to the  petitions. Admitting that the  petitioners had been arrested and detained, the respondents nevertheless  justified such arrest and detention as having been legally ordered by the  President of the Philippines pursuant to his proclamation of martial law, the  petitioners being regarded as participants or as having given aid and comfort  ""in the conspiracy to seize political and state power and to take over the  government by force."" The respondents traversed the petitioners'  contention that their arrest and detention were unconstitutional. Hearings were held on September 26 and 29 and October 6, 1972 , at which the  petitioners were produced in Court. Thereafter the parties filed memoranda. Meanwhile, some of the petitioners, with leave of Court, withdrew  their petitions; [1] others, without doing so, were subsequently released from custody under certain  restrictive conditions. [2] Enrique Voltaire Garcia II, the sole petitioner in L-35547 and one of those  released, having died shortly after his release, the action was deemed abated  as to him. As of this date only Jose W. Diokno , in  whose behalf the petition in L-35539 was filed, and Benigno S. Aquino , Jr. in L-35546, are still in military  custody. On August 23, 1973 the petitioner Aquino filed an action for certiorari and prohibition with this Court, alleging  that on August 11, 1973 charges of murder, subversion and illegal possession of  firearms were filed against him with a military commission; that his trial by  the military court which was to be held on August 27, 29 and 31, 1973 was  illegal because the proclamation of martial law was unconstitutional; and that  he could not expect a fair trial because the President of the Philippines,  having prejudged his case, could reverse any judgment of acquittal by the  military court and sentence him to death. That action, docketed as L-37364 and entitled  "" Benigno S. Aquino ,  Jr. vs. Military Commission No. 2,"" is still pending consideration and  decision. On the other hand, Jose W. Diokno , on  December 28, 1973, filed a motion to withdraw the petition filed in his behalf,  imputing delay in the disposition of his case, and asseverating that because of  the decision of the Court in the Ratification Cases [3] and the action of the members of the Court [4] in taking an oath to support the new Constitution, he cannot ""reasonably  expect to get justice in this case."" The respondents oppose the motion on  the grounds that there is a public interest in the decision of these cases and  that the reasons given for the motion to withdraw are untrue, unfair and  contemptuous. II The threshold question is whether to allow the withdrawal of the  petition in L-35539 filed in behalf of Diokno . In his letter to his counsel, which is the  basis of the motion to withdraw, Diokno states the  following considerations: first ,  the delay in the disposition of his case; second , the dismissal of the  petitions in the Ratification Cases, contrary to the Court's ruling that the  1973 Constitution was not validly ratified; and third , the action of the  members of the Court in taking an oath of allegiance to the new  Constitution. Diokno asserts that ""a conscience that allows a man to rot behind bars for more  than one year and three months without trial — of course, without any charges  at all — is a conscience that has become stunted, if not stultified,"" and  that ""in swearing to support the new 'Constitution,' the five members of  the Court who had held that it had not been validly ratified, have not  fulfilled our expectations."" He goes on to say: ""I do not blame them. I do not know what I would have done in their  place. But, at the same time, I can not  continue to entrust my case to them; and I have become thoroughly convinced  that our quest for justice in my case is futile."" As already noted, the Solicitor General, in behalf of the  respondents, opposes the withdrawal of the petition on the ground of public  interest, adding that the motion to withdraw cannot be granted by the Court  without in effect admitting the ""unfair, untrue and contemptuous""  statements contained therein. Without passing on the liability of any party in this case for  contemptuous statements made, the Court (by a vote of 5 to 7) denied the  motion. I voted for the denial of the motion to withdraw for inescapable  reasons that I now proceed to expound. The general rule is that in the absence of a statute expressly or  impliedly prohibiting the withdrawal of an action, the party bringing such  action may dismiss it even without the consent of the defendant or respondent  where the latter will not be prejudiced, although it may be necessary to obtain  leave of court. But there are recognized  exceptions: when the public interest  or questions of public importance are involved. [5] For example, the fact that a final determination of a question involved in an  action is needed or will be useful as a guide for the conduct of public  officers or tribunals is a sufficient reason for retaining an action which  would or should otherwise be dismissed. Likewise, appeals may be retained if the questions involved are likely  to arise frequently in the future unless they are settled by a court of last  resort. Thus, in Gonzales vs. Commission on Elections , [6] an action for declaratory judgment impugning the validity of Republic Act No.  4880 which prohibits the early nomination of candidates for elective offices  and early election campaigns or partisan political activities became moot by  reason of the holding of the 1967 elections before decision could be  rendered. Nonetheless the Court treated  the petition as one for prohibition and rendered judgment in view of ""the  paramount public interest and the undeniable necessity for a ruling, the  national elections [of 1969] being barely six months away."" In Krivenko vs. Register of  Deeds , [7] the Court denied the petition to withdraw an appeal in view of the public  importance of the questions involved, and lest ""the constitutional mandate  [proscribing the sale of lands to aliens] . . . be ignored or misconceived,  with all the harmful consequences . . . upon the national economy."" The petitioner Diokno has made  allegations to the effect that the President has ""arrogated"" unto  himself the powers of government by ""usurping"" the powers of Congress  and ""ousting"" the courts of their jurisdiction, thus establishing in  this country a ""virtual dictatorship."" Diokno and his counsel have in fact stressed that the present trend of events in this  country since the proclamation of martial law bears a resemblance to the trend  of events that led to the establishment of a dictatorship in Germany under Hitler. There is thus a profound  public interest in the resolution of the questions raised in the cases at bar,  questions that, in the phrase of Chief Justice Marshall in Marbury vs. Madison , [8] are ""deeply interesting to the nation."" I apprehend that in view of  the import of the allegations made by Diokno and his  counsel, incalculable harm or, in the very least, great disservice may be  caused to the national interest if these cases are not decided on the  merits. As the Solicitor General has  observed, ""petitioner's [ Diokno's ] arrest and  detention have been so exploited in the hate campaign that the only way to  protect the integrity of the government is to insist on a decision of this case  in the forum in which the petitioner had chosen to bring them. Otherwise, like festering sores, the issues  stirred up by this litigation will continue to agitate the nation."" Prescinding from the policy considerations  just discussed, I am gladdened that the Court has not shunted aside what I  regard as the inescapable moral constraints in the petitioner Diokno's motion to withdraw his petition for habeas  corpus . [9] The Court repudiated the facile recourse of avoiding resolution of the issues  on the pretext that Diokno insists on withdrawing his  petition. It is thus not a mere  happenstance that, notwithstanding that seven members of the Court are of the  view that Diokno has an absolute right to withdraw  his petition, the Court has confronted the issues posed by him, and now  resolves them squarely, definitively and courageously. No respectable legal historian or responsible  chronicler of the nation's destiny will therefore have any reason to level the  indictment that once upon a grave national crisis the Court abdicated its  constitutional prerogative of adjudication and forswore the sacred trust  reposed in it as the nation's ultimate arbiter on transcendental, far-reaching justiciable questions. With respect to the reasons given for the motion to withdraw, the  Court is mindful that it has taken some time to resolve these cases. In explanation let it be said that the issues  presented for resolution in these cases are of the utmost gravity and  delicateness. No question of the awesome  magnitude of those here presented has ever confronted the Court in all its  history. I am not aware that any other  court, except possibly the Circuit Court in Ex parte Merryman , [10] has decided like questions during the period of the emergency that called for  the proclamation of martial law. But then in Merryman the Court  there held that under the U.S. Federal Constitution the President did not have  power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus . Otherwise, where the question involved not  power but rather the exercise of power, courts have declined to rule against  the duly constituted authorities while the emergency lasted. As Glendon Schubert  noted, the U.S. Supreme Court ""was unwilling to [do so] until the war was  over and Lincoln was dead."" Thus, in Ex parte Milligan, [11] the decision voiding the petitioner's trial by a military court was not  announced until December 14, 1866 ,  after the Civil War was over. The Civil  War began on May 3, 1861 with the capture of Fort Sumter by Confederate forces. Lambdin Milligan was charged before a military commission  with aiding rebels, inciting insurrection, disloyal practices and violation of  the laws of war. His trial ran from  September to December 1862; he was convicted on October 21, 1864 and ordered executed on May 19, 1865 . On May   10, 1865 he applied for a writ of habeas corpus from the  Circuit Court of Indianapolis. On May  11, Justice Davis and Judge McDonald certified that they differed in opinion  and, therefore, pursuant to the statute of 1802, elevated their questions to  the Supreme Court. On June 3, 1865 the death sentence was  commuted to life imprisonment by President Johnson who had succeeded to the  Presidency after the assassination of Lincoln . The Supreme Court heard the parties'  arguments for eight days, on March 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13, and April 3, 1866 . On December   14, 1866 the decision of the Supreme Court voiding Milligan's trial  was announced. In In Re Moyer , [12] martial rule was proclaimed in Colorado on March 23, 1904 . Application for a writ of habeas corpus was filed with the State Supreme Court on April 14, 1904 , seeking the release of Moyer who had been  detained under the Colorado governor's proclamation. On June 6, 1904 the complaint was  dismissed and the petitioner was remanded to the custody of the military  authorities. The Court held that as an  incident to the proclamation of martial law, the petitioner's arrest and  detention were lawful. Moyer  subsequently brought an action for damages for his imprisonment from March 30  to June 15, 1904 . The complaint was dismissed by the Circuit  Court. On writ of error, the U.S.  Supreme Court affirmed, holding that ""So long as such arrests are made in  good faith and in the honest belief that they are needed in order to head the  insurrection off, the governor is the final judge and cannot be subjected to an  action after he is out of office, on the ground that he had no reasonable  ground for his belief."" [13] Finally, in Duncan vs. Kahanamoku , [14] Hawaii was placed under martial rule on December   7, 1941 , after the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor . The petitioner Duncan was tried by a  provost court on March 2, 1944 and found guilty on April 13 of assault on two marine sentries. The other petitioner, White, was charged on August 25, 1942 , also before a  provost court, with embezzling stocks belonging to another civilian. White and Duncan questioned the power  of the military tribunals in petitions for habeas corpus filed with the  District Court of Hawaii on March 14 and April 14, 1944 , respectively. Writs were granted on May 2, 1944 , and after trial the District Court  held the military trials void and ordered the release of Duncan and  White. On October 24, 1944 the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus was restored and martial law was terminated in Hawaii . On appeal, the decision of the District Court  was reversed. [15] Certiorari was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court on February 12, 1945 . [16] On February 25, 1946 the  Court held that the trials of White and Duncan by the military tribunals  were void. In truth, as the Court in Milligan recognized, its  decision could not have been made while the Civil War lasted. Justice Davis wrote: ""During the Wicked Rebellion, the temper of the times did not  allow that calmness in deliberation and discussion so necessary to a correct  conclusion of a purely judicial question. Then, considerations of safety were mingled with the exercise of power;  and feelings and interests prevailed which are happily terminated. Now that the public safety is assured, this  question, as well as all others, can be discussed and decided without passion  or the admixture of any element not required to form a  legal judgment. We approached the  investigation of this case, fully sensible of the magnitude of the inquiry and  the necessity of full and cautious deliberation."" [17] No doubt there is a point, although controversial, in the  observation that in the instances just examined a successful challenge was  possible only retroactively, after the cessation of the hostilities which would  under any circumstances have justified the judgment of the military. [18] Nor did it offend against principle or ethics for the members of  this Court to take an oath to support the 1973 Constitution. After this Court declared that, with the  dismissal of the petitions questioning the validity of the ratification of the  new Constitution, there was ""no longer any judicial obstacle to the new  Constitution being considered in force and effect,"" [19] it became the duty of the members of the Court, let alone all other government  functionaries, to take an oath to support the new Constitution. While it is true that a majority of six  justices declared that the 1973 Constitution was not validly ratified, it is  equally true that a majority of six justices held that the issue of its effectivity was a political question, which the  Court was not equipped to determine, depending as it did on factors for which  the judicial process was not fit to resolve. Resolution of this question was dispositive of  all the issues presented in the Ratification Cases. It thus became untenable for the members of  the Court who held contrary opinions to press their opposition beyond the  decision of those cases. Fundamental  respect for the rule of law dictated that the members of the Court take an oath  to uphold the new Constitution. There is  nothing in that solemn oath that debases their individual personal integrity or  renders them unworthy or incapable of doing justice in these cases. Nor did the environmental milieu of their  adjuration in any manner demean their high offices or detract from the  legitimacy of the Court as the highest judicial collegium of the land. III From its Anglo-Saxon origin and throughout its slow evolution,  the concept, scope and boundaries, application, limitations and other facets of  martial law have been the subject of misunderstanding, controversy and debate. [20] To the legal scholar interested in set legal principles and precise  distinctions, martial law could be a frustrating subject. On the matter of its definition alone, it is  known to have as many definitions as there are numerous authors and court  decisions (not to discount the dissenting opinions) on the subject. The doctrinal development of martial law has  relied mainly on case-law, [21] and there have been relatively few truly distinctive types of occasions where  martial law, being the extraordinary remedy that it is, has been resorted to. In the Philippines ,  the only other notable instance when martial law was declared was on September 22, 1944 , per Proclamation  No. 29 promulgated by President Jose P. Laurel. But this was pursuant to the constitution of the short-lived Japanese Occupation Republic ,  and the event has not been known to be productive of any jurisprudential  pronouncements emanating from the high court of the land. Notwithstanding the confused state of jurisprudence on the  subject of martial law in England and in the United States, and, consequently,  in the Philippines, a useful knowledge of the law on the subject can fairly be  had from a study of its historical background and its rationale, its doctrinal  development, applicable constitutional and statutory provisions, and  authoritative court decisions and commentaries. Legal scholars trace the genesis of martial law to England starting from the age of the Tudors and the Stuarts in the 14th century when it  was first utilized for the suppression of rebellions and disorders. It later came to be employed in the British  colonies and dominions where its frequent exercise against British subjects  gave rise to the criticism that it was being exploited as a weapon to enhance  British imperialism. [22] In the United States ,  martial law was declared on numerous occasions from the revolutionary period to  the Civil War, and after the turn of the century. One of the earliest instances in American  history was the declaration of martial law by Gen. Andrew Jackson before the  Battle of New Orleans in 1814. Fearing  that the New Orleans legislature  might capitulate to the British, he placed the State under ""strict martial  law"" and forbade the State legislature to convene. Martial law was lifted after the American  victory over British arms. The Civil War  period saw the declaration of martial law on many occasions by both the  Confederate and the Union authorities. It has also been resorted to in cases of insurrection and rebellion, as  exemplified by the Whiskey rebellion (1794 in Pennsylvania and Virginia ) and the Dorr's  rebellion (1842 in Rhode Island ). Martial law has also been utilized during  periods of disaster, such as the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906, and in industrial disputes involving violence and  disorder. It has likewise been variously  instituted to police elections, to take charge of ticket sales at a football  game, to prevent the foreclosure of mortgages, to close a race track. In an extreme case, the governor of Georgia proclaimed martial law around a government building to exclude from its  premises a public official whom he was enjoined from removing. [23] At the close of the World War I, the term ""martial law""  was erroneously employed to refer to the law administered in enemy territory  occupied by the allied forces pending the armistice. [24] William Winthrop states that the earlier confusion regarding the concept of  martial law, resulting partly from the wrong definition of the term by the Duke  of Wellington who had said that ""it is nothing more nor less than the will of the general,"" had misled even the Supreme Court  of the United States . [25] In the leading case of Ex Parte Milligan , [26] however, Chief Justice Chase, in his dissenting opinion, clarified and laid  down the classic distinctions between the types of military jurisdiction in relation to the terms ""martial law,"" ""military law"" and  "" military government ,"" which to a great extent cleared the  confusion in the application of these terms. These distinctions were later incorporated in the Manual for  Courts-Martial of the United States Army, [27] after which the Manual for Courts-Martial of the Armed Forces of the Philippines ,  promulgated on December 17, 1938 pursuant to Executive Order No. 178, was patterned. In essence, these distinctions are as  follows: a. Military jurisdiction  in relation to the term military law is that exercised by a government  ""in the execution of that branch of its municipal law which regulates its  military establishment."" (In the U.S. and the Philippines ,  this refers principally to the statutes which embody the rules of conduct and  discipline of members of their respective armed forces. In the Philippines we have for this purpose Commonwealth Act No. 408, as amended, otherwise known  as ""The Articles of War""). b. Military jurisdiction  in relation to the term martial law is that ""exercised in time of  rebellion and civil war by a government temporarily governing the civil  population of a locality through its military forces, without the authority of  written law, as necessity may require."" [28] c. Military jurisdiction in relation to the term military  government is that ""exercised by a belligerent occupying an enemy's  territory;” [29] (A familiar example of a military government was, of course, that  established and administered by the Japanese armed forces in the Philippines  from 1942 to 1945). What is the universally accepted fundamental justification of  martial law? Wiener, in A Practical  Manual of Martial Law , [30] ventures this justification: ""Martial Law is the public law of necessity. Necessity calls it forth, necessity justifies  its existence, and necessity measures the extent and degree to which it may be  employed."" Martial law is founded, upon the principle that the state has a  right to protect itself against those who would destroy it, and has therefore  been likened to the right of the individual to self-defense. [31] It is invoked as an extreme measure, and rests upon the basic principle that  every state has the power of self-preservation, a power inherent in all states,  because neither the state nor society would exist without it. [32] IV I now proceed to discuss the issues posed in these cases. In Proclamation 1081, dated September 21, 1972, the President of  the Philippines declared that lawless elements, supported by a foreign power,  were in ""armed insurrection and rebellion against the Government of the  Philippines in order to forcibly seize political and state power, overthrow the  duly constituted government and supplant our existing political, social,  economic and legal order with an entirely new one . . . based on the  Marxist-Leninist-Maoist teachings and beliefs."" He enumerated many and  varied acts of violence committed in pursuance of the insurrection and  rebellion. He therefore placed the  Philippines under martial law, commanded the armed forces to suppress the  insurrection and rebellion, enforce obedience to his decrees, orders and  regulations, and arrest and detain those engaged in the insurrection and  rebellion or in other crimes ""in furtherance or on the occasion thereof,  or incident thereto or in connection therewith."" The President invoked his  powers under article VII section 10(2) of the 1935 Constitution ""to save  the Republic and reform our society. [33] By General Order No. 2 the President directed the Secretary of  National Defense to ""forthwith arrest or cause the arrest . . . the  individuals named in the attached lists for being participants or for having  given aid and comfort in the conspiracy to seize political and state power in  the country and to take over the government by force . . . in order to prevent  them from further committing acts that are inimical or injurious . . .""  The Secretary was directed to hold in custody the individuals so arrested  ""until otherwise so ordered by me or by my duly designated  representative."" The arrest and detention of the petitioners in these  cases appear to have been made pursuant to this order. I cannot blink away the stark fact of a continuing Communist  rebellion in the Philippines . The Court has repeatedly taken cognizance of  this fact in several cases decided by it. In 1971, in Lansang vs. Garcia , [34] the Court, after reviewing the history of the Communist movement in the country  since the 1930s, concluded: ""We  entertain, therefore, no doubts about the existence of a sizeable group of men  who have publicly risen in arms to overthrow the government and have thus been  and still are engaged in rebellion against the Government of the  Philippines."" It affirmed this finding in 1972 [35] in sustaining the validity of the Anti-Subversion Act (Republic Act 1700). The Act is itself a congressional recognition  and acute awareness of the continuing threat of Communist subversion to  democratic institutions in this country. Enacted in 1957, it has remained in the statute books despite periodic  agitation in many quarters for its total excision. At times the rebellion required no more than ordinary police action,  coupled with criminal prosecutions. Thus  the 1932 Communist trials resulted in the conviction of the well-known  Communists of the day: Crisanto Evangelista, Jacinto G. Manahan, Dominador J. Ambrosio , Guillermo Capadocia , Ignacio Nabong and  Juan Feleo , among others, for crimes ranging from  illegal association to rebellion and sedition. [36] The end of World War II saw the resurgence of the Communist  rebellion. Now with an army forged out  of the former Hukbalahaps (the armed  resistance against the Japanese) and renamed Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan or HMB, the threat to the security of the state  became so malevolent that on October 22, 1950, President Elpidio Quirino was impelled to suspend the privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus . This  enabled the Government to effect the apprehension of  top Communist Party leaders Guillermo Capadocia , Flavio Nava, Amado V. Hernandez,  Jesus Lava, Jose Lava, Angel Baking and Simeon Rodriguez, among others. [37] When challenged by one of those detained under the Presidential proclamation,  the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus was  sustained by the Court. [38] The beginning of the 1970s was marked by the rise of student  activism. This phenomenon swept around  the globe, and did not spare our own colleges and universities. Soon the campuses became staging grounds for  student demonstrations that generally ended in bloody and not infrequently  lethal street riots. In Navarro vs. Villegas , [39] in upholding the power of the Mayor of Manila to determine the place and time  for the holding of public assemblies, this Court noted — ""That experiences in connection with present assemblies and  demonstrations do not warrant the Court's disbelieving respondent Mayor's  appraisal that a public rally at Plaza Miranda, as compared to one at the  Sunken Gardens as he suggested, poses a clearer and more imminent danger of  public disorders, breaches of the peace, criminal acts, and even bloodshed as  an aftermath of such assemblies, and petitioner has manifested that it has no  means of preventing such disorders; ""That, consequently, every time that such assemblies are  announced, the community is placed in such a state of fear and tension that  offices are closed early and employees dismissed, storefronts boarded up,  classes suspended, and transportation disrupted, to the general detriment of  the public."" Riding on the crest of student unrest, the Communist rebellion  gained momentum. As the Court noted in Lansang vs. Garcia , [40] ""[T]he reorganized Communist Party of the Philippines has, moreover,  adopted Mao's concept of protracted people's war, aimed at the paralyzation of the will to resist of the government, of  the political, economic and intellectual leadership, and of the people  themselves; that conformably to such concept the Party has placed special  emphasis upon a most extensive and intensive program of subversion by the  establishment of front organizations in urban centers, the organization of  armed city partisans and the infiltration in student groups, labor unions, and  farmer and professional groups; that the CPP has managed to infiltrate or  establish and control nine (9) major labor organizations; that it has exploited  the youth movement and succeeded in making Communist fronts of eleven (11)  major student or youth organizations; that there are, accordingly, about thirty  (30) mass organizations actively advancing the CPP interests, among which are  the Malayang Samahan ng Magsasaka (MASAKA), the Kabataang Makabayan (KM), the  Movement for the Advancement of Nationalism (MAN), the Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan (SDK), the Samahang Molave (SM), and the Malayang Pagkakaisa ng Kabataang Pilipino (MPKP); that, as of August, 1971, the KM had two hundred forty-five  (245) operational chapters throughout the Philippines, of which seventy-three  (73) were in the Greater Manila Area, sixty (60) in Northern Luzon, forty-nine  (49) in Central Luzon, forty-two (42) in the Visayas and twenty-one (21) in Mindanao and Sulu ; that in  1970, the Party had recorded two hundred fifty-eight (258) major demonstrations,  of which about thirty-three (33) ended in violence, resulting in fifteen (15)  killed and over five hundred (500) injured; that most of these actions were  organized, coordinated or led by the aforementioned front organizations; that  the violent demonstrations were generally instigated by a small, but  well-trained group of armed agitators; that the number of demonstrations  heretofore staged in 1971 has already exceeded those in 1970; and that  twenty-four (24) of these demonstrations were violent, and resulted in the  death of fifteen (15) persons and the injury of many more.” The mounting level of violence necessitated the suspension, for  the second time, of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus on August 21, 1971 . The Government's action was questioned in Lansang vs. Garcia . This Court found that the intensification and  spread of Communist insurgency imperiled the state. The events after the suspension of the  privilege of the writ confirmed the alarming extent of the danger to public  safety: ""Subsequent events — as reported — have also proven that  petitioners' counsel have underestimated the threat to public safety posed by  the New People's Army. Indeed, it  appears that, since August 21, 1971, it had in Northern Luzon six (6)  encounters and staged one (1) raid, in consequence of which seven (7) soldiers  lost their lives and two (2) others were wounded, whereas the insurgents  suffered five (5) casualties; that on August 26, 1971, a well-armed group of  NPA, trained by defector Lt. Victor Corpus, attacked the very command post of  TF LAWIN in Isabela , destroying two (2) helicopters  and one (1) plane, and wounding one (1) soldier; that the NPA had in Central  Luzon a total of four (4) encounters, with two (2) killed and three (3) wounded  on the side of the Government, one (1) BSDU killed and three (3) NPA  casualties; that in an encounter at Botolan , Zambales , one (1) KM-SDK leader, an unidentified dissident,  and Commander Panchito , leader of the dissident  group, were killed; that on August 26, 1971, there was an encounter in the  Barrio of San Pedro, Iriga City, Camarines Sur , between the PC and the NPA, in which a PC and  two (2) KM members were killed; that the current disturbances in Cotabato and the Lanao provinces  have been rendered more complex by the involvement of the CPP/NPA for, in  mid-1971, a KM group, headed by Jovencio Esparagoza , contacted the Higa-onan tribes, in their settlement in Magsaysay , Misamis Oriental, and offered them books, pamphlets and  brochures of Mao Tse Tung ,  as well as conducted teach-ins in the reservation; that Esparagoza was reportedly killed on September 22, 1971, in an operation of the PC in said  reservation; and that there are now two (2) NPA cadres in Mindanao. ""It should, also, be noted that adherents of the CPP and its  front organizations are, according to intelligence findings, definitely capable  of preparing powerful explosives out of locally available materials; that the  bomb used in the Constitutional Convention Hall was a 'clay-more' mine, a  powerful explosive device used by the U.S. Army, believed to have been one of  many pilfered from the Subic Naval Base a few days  before; that the President had received intelligence information to the effect  that there was a July-August Plan involving a wave of assassinations,  kidnappings, terrorism and mass destruction of property and that an  extraordinary occurrence would signal the beginning of said event; that the  rather serious condition of peace and order in Mindanao, particularly in Cotabato and Lanao , demanded the  presence therein of forces sufficient to cope with the situation; that a  sizeable part of our armed forces discharges other functions; and that the  expansion of the CPP activities from Central Luzon to other parts of the  country, particularly Manila and its suburbs, the Cagayan Valley, Ifugao , Zambales ,  Laguna, Quezon and Bicol Region, required that the rest of our armed forces be spread thin over a wide  area."" [41] By virtue of these findings, the Court, led by Chief Justice  Roberto Concepcion , unanimously upheld the suspension  of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus . The Court said: ""Considering that the President was in possession of the above  data — except those related to events that happened after August 21, 1971 —  when the Plaza Miranda bombing took place, the Court is not prepared to hold  that the Executive had acted arbitrarily or gravely abused his discretion when  he then concluded that public safety and national security required the  suspension of the privilege of the writ, particularly if the NPA were to strike  simultaneously with violent demonstrations staged by the two hundred forty-five  (245) KM chapters, all over the Philippines, with the assistance and  cooperation of the dozens of CPP front organizations, and the bombing of water  mains and conduits, as well as electric power plants and installations — a  possibility which, no matter how remote, he was bound to forestall, and a  danger he was under obligation to anticipate and arrest. ""He had consulted his advisers and sought their views. He had reason to feel that the situation was  critical — as, indeed, it was — and demanded immediate action. This he took believing in good faith that  public safety required it. And, in the  light of the circumstances adverted to above, he had substantial grounds to  entertain such belief."" [42] The suspension of the privilege of the writ was lifted on January 7, 1972 , but soon thereafter  chaos engulfed the nation again. A large  area of the country was in open rebellion. The authority of the Government was frontally challenged by a coalition  of forces. It was against this backdrop  of violence and anarchy that martial law was proclaimed on September 21, 1972 . Personally, I take notice of this condition, in addition to what  the Court has found in cases that have come to it for decision, and there is no  cogent reason for me to say as a matter of law that the President exceeded his  powers in declaring martial law. Nor do  I believe that the Solicitor General's manifestation of May 13, 1974 to the  effect that while on the whole the military challenge to the Republic has been  overcome there are still large areas of conflict which warrant the continued  imposition of martial law, can be satisfactorily controverted by the petitioners or by any perceptive observer of the national scene. As I will point out in this opinion, the fact that courts are  open cannot be accepted as proof that the rebellion and insurrection, which  compellingly called for the declaration of martial law, no longer imperil the  public safety. Nor are the many surface  indicia adverted to by the petitioners (the increase in the number of tourists,  the choice of Manila as the site of  international conferences and of an international beauty contest) to be  regarded as evidence that the threat to public safety has abated. There is actual armed combat, attended by the  somber panoply of war, raging in Sulu and Cotabato , not to mention the Bicol region and Cagayan valley. [43] I am hard put to say, therefore, that the Government's claim is baseless. I am not insensitive to the plea made here in the name of  individual liberty. But to paraphrase Ex parte Moyer , [44] if it were the liberty alone of the petitioner Diokno that is in issue we would probably resolve the doubt in his favor and grant his  application. But the Solicitor General,  who must be deemed to represent the President and the Executive Department in  these cases, [45] has manifested that in the President's judgment peace and tranquility cannot be  speedily restored in the country unless the petitioners and others like them  meantime remain in military custody. For, indeed, the central matter involved is not merely the liberty of  isolated individuals, but the collective peace, tranquility and security of the  entire nation. V The 1935 Constitution committed to the President the  determination of the public exigency or exigencies requiring the proclamation  of martial law. It provided in article  VII, section 10(2) that- ""The President shall be commander-in-chief of all armed forces  of the Philippines and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to  prevent or suppress lawless violence, [46] invasion, insurrection, or rebellion. In  case of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when  the public safety requires it, he may suspend the privileges of the writ of habeas  corpus , or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law."" [47] In the 1934 Constitutional Convention it was proposed to vest the  power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in the  National Assembly. The proposal,  sponsored by Delegate Araneta , would give this power  to the President only in cases where the Assembly was not in session and then  only with the consent of the Supreme Court. But the majority of the delegates entertained the fear that the  Government would be powerless in the face of danger. [48] They rejected the Araneta proposal and adopted  instead the provisions of the Jones Law of 1916. The framers of the Constitution realized the  need for a strong Executive, and therefore chose to retain the provisions of  the former organic acts, [49] which, adapted to the exigencies of colonial administration, naturally made the  Governor General a strong Executive. Construing a similar provision of the Philippine Bill of 1902  which authorized the Governor General, with the approval of the Philippine  Commission, to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus ""when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the public safety  may require it,"" this Court held that the Governor General's finding as to  the necessity for such action was ""conclusive and final"" on the  judicial department. [50] This ruling was affirmed in 1952 in Montenegro vs. Castañeda , [51] this Court stating that - "" the authority to decide whether the  exigency has arisen requiring the suspension belongs to the President and 'his  decision is final and conclusive' upon the courts and upon all other  persons."" It is true that in Lansang vs. Garcia [52] there is language that appears to detract from the uniform course of judicial  construction of the Commander-in-­Chief Clause. But a close reading of the opinion in that case shows that in the main  there was adherence to precedents. To be  sure, the Court there asserted the power to inquire into the ""existence of  the factual bases [for the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus ] in order to determine the sufficiency thereof."" But this broad  assertion of power is qualified by the Court's unambiguous statement that  ""the function of the Court is merely to check — not to supplant — the  Executive, or to ascertain merely whether he has gone beyond the constitutional  limits of his jurisdiction, not to exercise the power vested in him or to  determine the wisdom of his act."" For this reason this Court announced  that the test was not whether the President acted correctly but whether he  acted arbitrarily. In fact this Court  read Barcelon and Montenegro as authorizing judicial inquiry into ""whether or not there really was a rebellion,  as stated in the proclamation therein contested."" Of course the judicial department can determine the existence of  the conditions for the exercise of the President's powers and is not bound by  the recitals of his proclamation. But  whether in the circumstances obtaining public safety requires the suspension of  the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or the proclamation of  martial law is initially for the President to decide. Considerations of commitment of the power to  the executive branch of the Government and the lack of accepted standards for  dealing with incommensurable factors, suggest the wisdom of considering the  President's finding as to necessity persuasive upon the courts. This conclusion results from the nature of  the power vested in the President and from the evident object  contemplated. For that power is intended  to enable the Government to cope with sudden emergencies and meet great  occasions of state under circumstances that may be crucial to the life of the  nation. [53] The fact that courts are open and in the  unobstructed discharge of their functions is pointed to as proof of the  absence of any justification for martial law. The ruling in Milligan [54] and Duncan [55] is invoked. In both cases the U.S.  Supreme Court reversed convictions by military commissions. In Milligan the Court stated that  ""martial law cannot arise from a threatened invasion. The necessity must be actual and present, the  invasion real, such as effectually closes the courts and deposes the civil  administration."" In Duncan a similar expression was made: ""The phrase 'martial law' . . . while intended to authorize the  military to act vigorously for the maintenance of an orderly civil government  and for the defense of the Islands against actual or  threatened rebellion or invasion, was not intended to authorize the supplanting  of courts by military tribunals.” But Milligan and Duncan were decided on the basis  of a widely disparate constitutional provision. What is more, to the extent that they may be regarded as embodying what  the petitioners call an ""open court” theory, they are of doubtful  applicability in the context of present-day subversion. Unlike the detailed provision of our Constitution, the U.S.  Federal Constitution does not explicitly authorize the U.S. President to  proclaim martial law. It simply states  in its article II, section 2 that ""the President shall be  Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United    States , and of the Militia of the several  States, when called into the actual Service of the United    States . . . ."" On the other hand, our  Constitution authorizes the proclamation of martial law in cases not only of  actual invasion, insurrection or rebellion but also of ""imminent  danger"" thereof. It is true that in Duncan the U.S. Supreme Court dealt with a U.S. statute that in terms was similar to the Philippine Constitution. Section 67 of the Hawaiian Organic Act  provided that ""[the Territorial Governor] may, in case of invasion, or  imminent danger thereof, when public safety requires it, suspend the privilege  of the writ of habeas corpus , or place the Territory, or any part  thereof under martial law until communication can be had with the President [of  the United States] and his decision thereon made known."" In fact the  Hawaiian Organic Act, that of Puerto Rico, and the Jones Law of 1916, from  which latter law, as I have earlier noted, the Commander-in-Chief Clause of our  Constitution was adopted, were part of the legislation of the U.S. Congress  during the colonial period. But again,  unlike the Jones Law, the Hawaiian Organic Act also provided in its section 5  that the U.S. Federal Constitution ""shall have the same force and effect  in the Territory [of Hawaii ] as  elsewhere in the United States .""  For this reason it was held in Duncan that ""imminent danger"" of invasion or rebellion was not a ground for  authorizing the trial of civilians by a military tribunal. Had Duncan been decided solely on the basis of section 67 of the Hawaiian Organic Act and  had the petitioners in that case been tried for offenses connected with the  prosecution of the war, [56] the prison sentences imposed by the military tribunals would in all probability  have been upheld. As a matter of fact  those who argued in Duncan that the power of the Hawaiian governor to proclaim martial law comprehended  not only actual rebellion or invasion but also ""imminent danger  thereof"" were faced with the problem of reconciling the two parts of the  Hawaiian Organic Act. They contended  that ""if any part of section 67 would otherwise be unconstitutional section  5 must be construed as extending the [ U.S. ]  Constitution to Hawaii subject to  the qualifications or limitations contained in section 67."" [57] Forsooth, if the power to proclaim martial law is at all  recognized in American federal constitutional law, it is only by implication  from the necessity of self-preservation and then subject to the narrowest  possible construction. Nor is there any State Constitution in the United    States , as the appended list indicates (see  Appendix), which in scope and explicitness can compare with the  Commander-in-Chief. Clause  of our Constitution. The Alaska  Constitution, for example, authorizes the governor to proclaim martial law when  the public safety requires it in case of rebellion or actual or imminent  invasion. But even then it also provides  that martial law shall not last longer than twenty days unless approved by a  majority of the legislature in joint session. On the other hand, the present Constitution of Hawaii does not grant to  the State governor the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus or to  proclaim martial law as did its Organic Act before its admission as a State to  the American Union. An uncritical reading of Milligan and Duncan is  likely to overlook these crucial differences in textual concepts between the  Philippine Constitution, on the one hand, and the Federal and State  Constitutions of the United States ,  on the other. In our case then the  inclusion of the ""imminent danger"" phrase as a ground for the  suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and for the  proclamation of martial law was a matter of deliberate choice and renders the  language of Milligan (""martial law cannot arise from a threatened  invasion"") inapposite arid therefore inapplicable. The Philippine Bill of 1902 provided in its section 2, paragraph  7 — ""that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall  not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion  the public safety may require it, in either of which events the same may be  suspended by the President, or by the Governor General with the approval of the  Philippine Commission, wherever during such period the necessity for such  suspension shall exist."" The Jones Law of 1916 substantially reenacted this  provision. Thus section 3, paragraph 7 thereof  provided: ""That the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall  not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion  the public safety may require it, in either of which events the same may be  suspended by the President or by the Governor General, wherever during such  period the necessity for such suspension shall exist."" In addition, the Jones Law provided in its section 21 that — "". . . [The Governor General] may, in case of rebellion or  invasion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it,  suspend the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus , or place the  Islands, or any part thereof, under martial law: Provided , That whenever the Governor  General shall exercise this authority, he shall at once notify the President of  the United States thereof, together with the attending facts and circumstances,  and the President shall have power to modify or vacate the action of the  Governor General."" Note that with respect to the suspension of the privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus , section 21 mentions, as ground therefor , ""imminent danger"" of invasion or  rebellion. When the Constitution was  drafted in 1934, its framers, as I have already noted, decided to adopt these  provisions of the Jones Law. What was  section 3, paragraph 7, in the Jones Law became section 1[14] of article III  (Bill of Rights) of the Constitution; and what was section 21 became article  VII, section 10(2) (Commander-in-Chief Clause). Thus, the Bill of Rights provision reads: ""The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not  be suspended except in cases of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, when the  public safety requires it, in any of which events the same may be suspended  wherever during such period the necessity for such suspension shall  exist."" On the other hand, the Commander-in-Chief Clause states: ""The President shall be commander-in?chief of all armed  forces of the Philippines and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to  prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or  rebellion. In case of invasion,  insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety  requires it, he may suspend the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus ,  or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law."" The attention of the 1934 Convention was drawn to the apparent  inconsistency between the Bill of Rights provision and the Commander-in-Chief  Clause . Some delegates tried to  harmonize the two provisions by inserting the phrase ""imminent danger  thereof"" in the Bill of Rights provision, but on reconsideration the  Convention deleted the phrase from the draft of the Bill of Rights provision,  at the same time retaining it in the Commander-in-Chief Clause. When this apparent inconsistency was raised in a suit [58] questioning the validity of President Quirino's suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, this Court  sustained the President's power to suspend the privilege of the writ even on  the ground of imminent danger of invasion, insurrection or rebellion. It held that as the Commander-in-Chief Clause  was last in the order of time and local position it should be deemed  controlling. This rationalization has  evoked the criticism that the Constitution was approved as a whole and not in  parts, but in result the decision in that case is certainly consistent with the  conception of a strong Executive to which the 1934 Constitutional Convention  was committed. The 1973 Constitution likewise authorizes the suspension of the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus on the ground of imminent danger  of invasion, insurrection or rebellion. The so-called ""open court"" theory does not apply to the  Philippine situation because our 1935 and 1973 Constitutions expressly  authorize the declaration of martial law even where the danger to public safety  arises merely from the imminence of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion. Moreover, the theory is too simplistic for  our day, what with the universally recognized insidious nature of Communist  subversion and its covert operations . Indeed the theory has been dismissed as unrealistic by perceptive  students of Presidential powers. Charles Fairman says: ""These measures are unprecedented but so is the danger that  called them into being. Of course we are  not without law, even in time of crisis. Yet the cases to which one is cited in the digests disclose such  confusion of doctrine as to perplex a lawyer who suddenly tries to find his  bearings. Hasty recollection of Ex parte Milligan recalls the dictum that 'Martial rule  cannot arise from a threatened invasion. The necessity must be actual and present; the invasion real, such as  effectually closes the courts and deposes the civil administration .' Not  even the aerial attack upon Pearl Harbor closed the courts  or of its own force deposed the civil administration; yet it would be the  common understanding of men that those agencies which are charged with the  national defense surely must have authority to take on the spot some measures  which in normal times would be ultra vires . And whilst college sophomores are taught that  the Milligan case stands as a constitutional landmark, the hard fact is that of late governors have frequently declared 'martial law' and 'war'  and have been judicially sustained in their measures. Undoubtedly, many of these cases involving  the suspension of strikers went much too far. But just as certainly — so it will be argued  here — the doctrine of the majority in Ex parte Milligan does not go far enough to meet the conditions of modern war."" [59] Clinton Rossiter writes: ""It is simply not true that 'martial  law cannot arise from a threatened invasion,' or that  'martial rule can never exist where the courts are open.' These statements do  not present an accurate definition of the allowable limits of the martial  powers of the President and Congress in the face of alien threats of internal  disorder. Nor was Davis '  dictum on the specific power of Congress in this matter any more accurate. And, however eloquent and quotable his words  on the untouchability of the Constitution in time of  actual crisis, they do not now, and did not then, express the realities  of American constitutional law."" [60] William Winthrop makes these thoughtful observations: ""It has been declared by the Supreme Court in Ex parte Milligan that 'martial law' is 'confined to the  locality of actual war,' and also that it 'can never exist when the courts are  open and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction.' But  this ruling was made by a bare majority — five — of the court, at a time of  great political excitement, and the opinion of the four other members, as  delivered by the Chief Justice, was to the effect that martial law is not  necessarily limited to time of war, but may be exercised at other periods of  'public danger,' and that the fact that the civil courts are open is not  controlling against such exercise, since they 'might be open and undisturbed in  the execution of their functions and yet wholly incompetent to avert threatened  danger or to punish with adequate promptitude and certainty the guilty.' It is  the opinion of the author that the view of the minority of the court is the  sounder and more reasonable one, and that the dictum of the majority was  influenced by a confusing of martial law proper with that military  government which exists only at a time and on the theatre of war, and which  was clearly distinguished from martial law by the Chief Justice in the  dissenting opinion — the first complete judicial definition of the  subject."" [61] ( emphasis supplied) In Queen vs. Bekker (on the  occasion of the Boer War) Justice Maasdorp categorically affirmed that ""the existence of civil courts is no proof  that martial law has become unnecessary."" [62] VI Given then the validity of the proclamation of martial law, the  arrest and detention of those reasonably believed to be engaged in the disorder  or in fomenting it is well nigh beyond questioning. Negate the power to make such arrest and  detention, and martial law would be ""mere parade, and rather encourage  attack than repel it."" [63] Thus, in Moyer vs. Peabody , [64] the Court sustained the authority of a State governor to hold temporarily in  custody one whom he believed to be engaged in fomenting trouble, and denied  recovery against the governor for the imprisonment. It was said that, as the governor ""may  kill persons who resist,"" he ""may use the milder measure of seizing  the bodies of those whom he considers in the way of restoring peace. Such arrests are not necessarily for punishment,  but are by way of precaution to prevent the exercise of hostile power. So long as such arrests are made in good  faith and in the honest belief that they are needed in order to head the  insurrection off, the Governor is the final judge and cannot be subjected to an  action after he is out of office on the ground that he had no reasonable ground  for his belief."" It is true that in Sterling vs. Constantin [65] the same Court set aside the action of a State governor taken under martial  law. But the decision in that case  rested on the ground that the action set aside had no direct relation to the  quelling of the uprising. There the  governor of Texas issued a proclamation stating that certain counties were in a  state of insurrection and declaring martial law in that territory. The proclamation recited that there was an  organized group of oil and gas producers in insurrection against conservation  laws of the State and that this condition had wrought such a state of public  feeling that if the State government could not protect the public's interest  they would take the law into their own hands. The proclamation further recited that it was necessary that the Railroad  Commission be given time to make orders regarding oil production. When the Commission issued an order limiting  oil production, the complainants brought suit in the District Court which  issued restraining orders, whereupon Governor Sterling ordered General Wolters of the Texas National Guards to enforce a limit on  oil production. It was this order of the  State governor that the District Court enjoined. On appeal the U.S. Supreme Court  affirmed. After assuming that the  governor had the power to declare martial law, the Court held that the order  restricting oil production was not justified by the exigencies of the  situation. "" . . . Fundamentally, the question here is not the power of  the Governor to proclaim that a state of insurrection, or tumult, or riot, or  breach of the peace exists, and that it is necessary to call military force to  the aid of the civil power. Nor does the  question relate to the quelling of disturbance and the overcoming of unlawful  resistance to civil authority. The  question before us is simply with respect to the Governor's attempt to regulate  by executive order the lawful use of complainants' properties in the production  of oil. Instead of affording them  protection in the exercise of their rights as determined by the courts, he  sought, by his executive orders, to make that exercise impossible."" On the other hand, what is involved here is the validity of the  detention order under which the petitioners were ordered arrested. Such order is, as I have already stated, a  valid incident of martial law. With  respect to such question Constantin held that  ""measures, conceived in good faith, in the face of the emergency and  directly related to the quelling of the disorder or the prevention of its  continuance, fall within the discretion of the Executive in the exercise of his  authority to maintain peace."" In the cases at bar, the respondents have  justified the arrest and detention of the petitioners on the ground of  reasonable belief in their complicity in the rebellion and insurrection. Except Diokno and Aquino , all the petitioners have been released from  custody, although subject to defined restrictions regarding personal movement  and expression of views. As the danger  to public safety has not abated, I cannot say that the continued detention of Diokno and Aquino and the  restrictions on the personal freedoms of the other petitioners are arbitrary,  just as I am not prepared to say that the continued imposition of martial rule  is unjustified. As the Colorado Supreme Court stated in denying the writ of habeas corpus in Moyer . [66] ""His arrest and detention in such circumstances are merely to prevent  him from taking part or aiding in a continuation of the conditions which the  governor, in the discharge of his official duties and in the exercise of the  authority conferred by law, is endeavoring to suppress."" VII While courts may inquire into or take judicial notice of the existence of conditions claimed to justify the exercise of the power to declare  martial law, [67] the determination of the necessity for the exercise of such power is  within the periphery of the constitutional domain of the President; and as long  as the measures he takes are reasonably related to the occasion involved,  interference by the courts is officious. I am confirmed in this construction of Presidential powers by the  consensus of the 1971 Constitutional Convention to strengthen the concept of a  strong Executive and by the confirmation of the validity of acts taken or done  after the proclamation of martial law in this country. The 1973 Constitution expressly authorizes  the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus as well as  the imposition of martial law not only on the occasion of actual invasion,  insurrection or rebellion, but also where the danger thereof is imminent. [68] Acrimonious discussion on this matter has thus become pointless and should  therefore cease. The new Constitution as well provides that — ""All proclamations,  orders, decrees, instructions, and acts promulgated, issued, or done by the  incumbent President shall be part of the law of the land, and shall remain  valid, legal, binding, and effective even after lifting of martial law or the  ratification of this Constitution, unless modified, revoked, or superseded by  subsequent proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions, or other acts of the  incumbent President, or unless expressly and explicitly modified or repealed by  the regular National Assembly."" [69] The effectivity of the new Constitution  is now beyond all manner of debate in view of the Court's decision in the  Ratification Cases [70] as well as the demonstrated acquiescense therein by  the Filipino people in the historic July 1973 national referendum. VIII It is thus evident that suspension of the privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus is unavoidably subsumed in a declaration of  martial law, since one basic objective of martial rule is to neutralize effectively  — by arrest and continued detention (and possibly trial at the proper and  opportune time) — those who are reasonably believed to be in complicity or are particeps criminis in the insurrection or rebellion. That  this is so and should be so is ineluctable; to deny this postulate is to negate  the very fundament of martial law: the  preservation of society and the survival of the state. To recognize the imperativeness and reality  of martial law and at the same time dissipate its efficacy by withdrawing from  its ambit the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus ,  is a proposition I regard as fatuous and therefore repudiate. ""Invasion and insurrection, both of them conditions of  violence, are the factual pre-­requisites of martial law . . . The rights of  person and property present no obstruction to the authorities acting under such  a regime, if the acts which encroach upon them are necessary to the  preservation or restoration of public order and safety. Princeps et res publica ex justa causa possunt rem meam auferre . All the procedures which are recognized adjuncts of executive crisis  government . . . are open to the persons who bear official authority under  martial law. The government may wield  arbitrary powers of police to allay disorder, arrest and detain without trial  all citizens taking part in this disorder and even punish them (in other  words, suspend the [privilege of the] writ of habeas corpus ), institute  searches and seizures without warrant, forbid public assemblies, set curfew hours,  suppress all freedom of expression, institute courts-martial for the summary  trial of crimes perpetrated in the course of this regime and calculated to  defeat its purposes. . ."" [71] (emphasis supplied) ""The point here is whether martial law is simply a shorthand  expression denoting the suspension of the writ, or whether martial law involves  not only the suspension of the writ but much more besides. . . . The latter  view is probably sounder because martial law, certainly in the present state of  its development, is not at all dependent on a suspension of the writ of habeas  corpus . . . . Where there has been violence or disorder in fact, continued  detention of offenders by the military is so far proper as to result in a  denial by the courts of writs releasing those detained. . . .” [72] IX Although the respondents, in their returns to the writs and in  their answers to the several petitions, have insisted on a disclaimer of the  jurisdiction of this Court, on the basis of General Orders Nos. 3 and 3-A, [73] their subsequent manifestations urging decision of these cases amount to an  abandonment of this defense. In point of  fact President Marcos has written, in unmistakable phrase, that ""Our  martial law is unique in that it is based on the supremacy of the civilian authority  over the military and on complete submission to the decision of the Supreme  Court. . . . For who is the dictator who would submit himself to a higher body  like the Supreme Court on the question of the constitutionality or validity of  his actions?"" [74] Construing this avowal of the President and the repeated urgings of  the respondents in the light of the abovequoted provision of the 1973 Constitution (Art. XVII, sec. 3(2)), it is my  submission that General Orders Nos. 3 and 3-A must be deemed revoked in so far  as they tended to oust the judiciary of jurisdiction over cases involving the  constitutionality of proclamations, decrees, orders or acts issued or done by  the President. X In sum and substance, I firmly adhere to these views: (1) that the proclamation of martial law in  September 1972 by the President was well within the aegis of the 1935  Constitution; (2) that because the Communist rebellion had not abated and  instead the evil ferment of subversion had proliferated throughout the  archipelago and in many places had exploded into the roar of armed and searing  conflict with all the sophisticated panoply of war, the imposition of martial  law was an ""imperative of national survival;"" (3) that the arrest and  detention of persons who were ""participants or gave aid and comfort in the  conspiracy to seize political and state power and to take over the government  by force,"" were not unconstitutional nor arbitrary; (4) that subsumed in the declaration of  martial law is the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus ; (5) that the fact that the regular courts of justice are open  cannot be accepted as proof that the rebellion and insurrection, which  compellingly called for the declaration of martial law, no longer imperil the  public safety; (6) that actual armed combat has been and still is raging in Cotabato , Lanao , Sulu and Zamboanga , not to  mention the Bicol Region and Cagayan Valley, and nationwide Communist subversion continues unabated; (7) that the  host of doubts that had plagued this Court with respect to the validity of the  ratification and consequent effectivity of the 1973  Constitution has been completely dispelled by every rational evaluation of the  national referendum of July 1973, at which the people conclusively, albeit  quietly, demonstrated nationwide acquiescence in the new Constitution; and (8)  that the issue of the validity and constitutionality of the arrest and  detention of all the petitioners and of the restrictions imposed upon those who  were subsequently freed, is now foreclosed by the transitory provision of the  1973 Constitution (Art. XVII, Sec. 3(2)) which efficaciously validates all acts  made, done or taken by the President, or by others upon his instructions, under  the regime of martial law, prior to the ratification of the said Constitution. XI It is not a mere surreal suspicion on the part of the petitioner Diokno that the incumbent members of this highest Tribunal  of the land have removed themselves from a level of conscience to pass judgment  upon his petition for habeas corpus or afford him relief from his  predicament. He has actually articulated  it as a formal indictment. I venture to  say that his obsessional preoccupation on the ability  of this Court to reach a fair judgment in relation to him has been, in no small  measure, engendered by his melancholy and bitter and even perhaps traumatic  detention. And even as he makes this serious indictment, he at the same time would withdraw his petition for habeas  corpus — hoping thereby to achieve martyrdom, albeit dubious and  amorphous. As a commentary on this  indictment, I here declare that for my part — and I am persuaded that all the  other members of this Court are situated similarly — I avow fealty to the full  intendment and meaning of the oath I have taken as a judicial magistrate. Utilizing the modest endowments that God has  granted me, I have endeavored in the past eighteen years of my judical career — and in the future will always endeavor —  to discharge faithfully the responsibilities appurtenant to my high office,  never fearing, wavering or hesitating to reach judgments that accord with my  conscience. ACCORDINGLY , I vote to dismiss all the petitions. [1] The following individuals, on their own motions, were allowed to withdraw their  petitions: Veronica L. Yuyitung (Supreme Court Res.

[33] President Marcos writes: ""The  compelling necessity [of the imposition of martial law in the Philippines]  arises out of the seven grave threats to the existence of the Republic: the communist rebellion, the rightist  conspiracy, the Muslim secessionist movement, the rampant corruption on all  levels of society, the criminal and criminal-political syndicates — including  the private armies — deteriorating economy and the increasing social  injustice.""

[43] The Times Journal, Bulletin Today and Daily Express , on Wednesday,  August 28, 1974, carried news of a nationwide arms-smuggling network being  operated by the Communist Party of the Philippines in collaboration with a  foreign-based source. The Department of  National Defense reported that several arms-smuggling vessels had been seized,  that the network had acquired several trucking services for its illegal  purposes, and that about P2 million had so far been expended for this operation  by a foreign source. The Department stressed  that ""the clandestine network is still operating with strong indications  that several arms landings have already been made."" The Department also  revealed that the military has ""launched necessary countermeasures in  order to dismantle in due time this extensive anti-government operation.""

The Times  Journal, Bulletin Today and Daily Express , on Thursday, August 29,  1974, carried the news that a secret arm of the Communist Party of the  Philippines engaged exclusively in the manufacture of explosives for sabotage  and other anti-government operations has been uncovered by the military,  following a series of raids by government security agents on underground  houses, two of which are business establishments providing funds for the  purchase of chemicals and other raw materials for the manufacture of  explosives. The documents seized in the  raids indicated that the ""explosives movement"" was a separate  subversive group organized in early 1972 under the direct supervision of the  CPP military arm and was composed of elite members knowledgeable in explosives  and chemical research. The Times  Journal, Bulletin Today and Daily Express , on Sunday, September 1,  1974, carried news of a nationwide ""communist-insurgent conspiracy"" to ""unite all  groups opposing the New Society, arm them and urge them to fight and overthrow  the government, and establish a coalition government under the leadership of  the Communist Party of the Philippines.""

[73] By General Order No. 3 dated September 22, 1972, as amended by General Order  No. 3-A of the same date, the President ordered, inter alia , that ""the Judiciary shall continue  to function in accordance with its present organization and personnel, and  shall try and decide in accordance with existing laws all criminal and civil  cases, except the following cases: 1. Those involving the validity,  legality, or constitutionality of Proclamation No. 1081, dated September 21,  1972, or of any decree, order or acts issued, promulgated or performed by me or  by my duly designated representative pursuant thereto."" [74] Ferdinand E. Marcos, Notes on the New  Society of the Philippines ,  99, 100 (1973). SEPARATE OPINION ESGUERRA, J. : A. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT On September 21, 1972 ,  the President issued Proclamation No. 1081 placing the whole Philippines under martial law. This proclamation was  publicly announced by the President over the television and radio on the  evening of September 23, 1972 . The grounds for the proclamation are recited  in detail in its preamble, specifically mentioning various acts of insurrection  and rebellion already perpetrated and about to be committed against the  Government by the lawless elements of the country in order to gain political  control of the state. After laying down  the basis for the establishment of martial law, the President ordered: ""NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the  Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested upon me by Article VII, Section 10,  Paragraph (2) of the Constitution, do hereby place the entire Philippines as  defined in Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution under martial law and, in  my capacity as their commander-in-chief, do hereby command the armed forces of  the Philippines to maintain law and order throughout the Philippines, prevent  suppress all forms of lawless violence as well, as any act of insurrection or  rebellion and to enforce obedience to all the laws and decrees orders and  regulations promulgated by me personally or upon my direction. In addition, I do hereby order that all persons presently detained,  as well as all others who may hereafter be similarly detained for the crimes of  insurrection or rebellion; and all other crimes and offenses committed in  furtherance or on the occasion thereof, or incident thereto, or in connection  therewith, for crimes against national security and the law of nations, crimes  against public order, crimes involving usurpation of authority, rank, title and  improper use of names, uniforms and insignia, crimes committed by public  officers, and for such, other crimes as will be enumerated in orders that I  shall subsequently promulgate, as well as crimes as a consequence of any  violation of any decree, order or regulation promulgated by me personally or  promulgated upon my direction shall be kept under detention until otherwise  ordered released by me or by my duly designated representative."" Issued shortly after the proclamation was General Order No. 2,  followed by No. 2-A, dated September 26, 1972, to which was attached a list of  the names of various persons who had taken part in the various acts of  insurrection, rebellion and subversion mentioned in the proclamation, and given  aid and comfort in the conspiracy to seize political and state power in the  country and take over the government by force. They were ordered to be apprehended immediately and taken into custody  by the Secretary of National Defense who was to act as representative of the  President in carrying out martial law. The petitioners herein were on September 22 and 23, 1972,  arrested and taken into military custody by the Secretary of National Defense  pursuant to General Order No. 2-A of the President for being included in said  list as having participated, directly or indirectly, or given aid and comfort  to those engaged in the conspiracy and plot to seize political and state power  and to take over the Government by force. They ask this Court to set them at liberty, claiming that their arrest  and detention is illegal and unconstitutional since the proclamation of martial  law is arbitrary and without basis and the alleged grounds therefor do not exist and the courts are open and normally functioning. For the respondents the Solicitor General in his answer maintains  that Proclamation No. 1081 is Constitutional and valid, having been issued in  accordance with the Constitution; that the orders and decrees issued thereunder are valid; that the arrest and detention of  petitioners pursuant thereto is likewise valid, legal and constitutional, and  that this Court should refrain from issuing the desired writs as these cases  involve a political question. After joinder of issues, these cases  were heard on September 26 and 29, 1972, and on October 6, 1972 , followed by the filing of Memoranda and  Notes on the arguments of both parties. After submission of these cases for decision, petitioner Jose W. Diokno filed a motion to be allowed to withdraw his  petition. To the motion is attached a  handwritten letter of said petitioner to his counsel stating the reasons why he  wished to withdraw his petition. The  principal reasons advanced by him for his action are his doubts and misgivings  on whether he can still obtain justice from this Court as at present  constituted since three of the Justices among the four who held in the  ratification cases that there was no valid ratification of the New Constitution  signed on November 30, 1972, and proclaimed ratified by the President on January  17, 1973 (the then Chief Justice having retired), had taken an oath to support  and defend the said Constitution; that in filing his petition he expected it to  be decided by the Supreme Court under the 1935 Constitution, and that with the  oath-taking of the three remaining members, he can no longer expect to obtain  justice. After the motion to withdraw had been deliberated upon by the  Court, seven justices voted to grant and five voted to deny the motion. There being no majority to grant the motion,  it was denied. Those who voted to deny  the motion are of the view that it is not simply a matter of right to withdraw  because of the great public interest involved in his case which should be  decided for the peace and tranquility of the nation, and because of the  contemptuous statement of petitioner Diokno that this  Court is no longer capable of administering justice to him. This question should no longer stand on the  way to the disposition of these cases on the merits. B. THE ISSUES Prescinding from the question of  jurisdiction which the Solicitor General raised by reason of the President's  General Order No. 3, dated September 22, 1972, as amended by General Order No.  3-A, dated September 24, 1972, which allowed the judicial courts, to regularly  function but inhibited them from taking cognizance of cases involving the  validity, legality or constitutionality of the Martial Law Proclamation, or any  decree, order or acts issued, promulgated or performed by the President or his  duly authorized representative pursuant thereto, from which position he  relented and he has, accordingly, refrained from pressing that issue upon the  Court, the main issues for resolution are the validity of Proclamation No. 1081  declaring and establishing martial law and whether this Court can inquire into  the veracity and sufficiency of the facts constituting the grounds for its  issuance. I maintain that Proclamation No. 1081 is constitutional, valid  and binding; that the veracity or sufficiency of its factual bases cannot be  inquired into by the Courts and that the question presented by the petitions is  political in nature and not justiciable . Proclamation No. 1081 was issued by the President pursuant to  Article VII, Section 10, paragraph 2, of the Constitution of 1935, which reads  as follows: ""The President shall be commander-in-chief of all armed forces  of the Philippines and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to  prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or  rebellion. In case of invasion,  insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety  requires it, he may suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law."" This provision may, for present purposes, be called the  Commander-in-Chief clause. The above provision has no counterpart in the Constitution of the United States or in that of any state thereof except that of Alaska to a limited extent. To comprehend the  scope and extent of the President's power to declare martial law, let us trace  the background and origin of this provision. To suppress the great rebellion in the United Slates, known as  the Civil War, which was aimed to wreck the Federal Union, President Lincoln  exercised powers not granted to him by the Constitution of the United Slates  but pertaining to the Congress. He had  suspended the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus; proclaimed martial law in  certain areas and Military Commissions were organized where it was deemed  necessary to do so in order to subdue the rebels or prevent their sympathizers  from promoting the rebellion. Lincoln justified his acts by saying: ""I did understand . . . that my oath to preserve the  Constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of preserving,  by every indispensable means that government — that nation — of which that  Constitution was the organic law. Was it  possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution? By general law, life and limb must be  protected, yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life; but, a life is  never, wisely given to save a limb. I  felt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become lawful by becoming  indispensable to the preservation of the Constitution through the preservation  of the nation. Right or wrong, I assumed  this ground, and now avow it …"" (2 Nicholay and  Hay, Abraham Lincoln Complete Works, 508 (1902)). Sydney G. Fisher in his work entitled ""Suspension of Habeas  Corpus during the War of the Rebellion,"" 3 Pol .  Science Quarterly, expressed the same idea when he said: ""... Every man thinks he has a right to live and every  government thinks it has a right to live. Every man when driven to the wall by  a murderous assailant will override all laws to protect himself, and this is  called the great right of self-defense. So every government, when driven to the wall by a rebellion, will  trample down a constitution before it will allow itself to be destroyed. This may not be constitutional law, but it is  fact."" (Pp. 454, 484-485) But the difficulty occasioned by the absence of a constitutional  power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and to proclaim  martial law, which greatly hamstrung Lincoln in coping effectively with the  civil war, was obviated when our own Constitution expressly provided for the  grant of that presidential power (Art. VII, Section 10, par. 2). Unlike the legislative power under the Bill  of Rights of our Constitution (Article III, Section 1, paragraph 14, 1935  Constitution), the President can suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus and impose martial law in cases of imminent danger of invasion,  insurrection or rebellion when the public safety requires it. The Congress could not have been granted the  power to suspend in case of imminent danger as it is not by the nature of its  office in a position to determine promptly the existence of such  situation. It can only see or witness  the actual occurrence thereof and when they happen, Congress is also empowered  to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus as an exercise of  legislative power when the President fails to act; but under no circumstances  can it declare martial law as this power is exclusively lodged in the President  as Commander-in-Chief. When the Philippine Constitution of 1935 was written, the framers  decided to adopt the provisions of Section 3, paragraph 7, of the Jones Law,  which became Article III, Section 1, paragraph 14, of the 1935 Constitution,  and those of Section 21 of the Jones Law which became Article VII, Section 10, paragraph 2, of the same. The Jones Law provisions read as follows: Section 3, paragraph 7 of the Jones Law provided: That the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be  suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the  public safety may require it, in either of which events the same may be  suspended by the President, or by the Governor-General, wherever during such  period the necessity for such suspension shall exist. And Section 21 of the same law in part provided that: . . . (H)e (referring to the Governor-General) may, in case of  rebellion or invasion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety  requires it, suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or place the  Islands, or any part thereof, under martial law: Provided That whenever  the Governor-General shall exercise this authority, he shall at once notify the  President of the United States thereof, together with the attending facts and  circumstances, and the President shall have power to modify or vacate the  action of the Governor-General. Before the Jones Law, the Philippine Bill  of 1902 provided as follows: ""That the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not  be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the  public safety may require it, in either of which events the same may be  suspended by the President, or by the Governor-General with the approval of the  Philippine Commission, whenever during such period the necessity for such  suspension shall exist."" (Section 2, par. 7) The Philippine Bill of 1902 had no  provision pertaining to the declaration of martial law. The adoption of the Jones Law provisions was prompted by the  prevailing sentiment among the delegates to the 1934-1935 Constitutional  Convention to establish a strong executive, as shown by its proceedings  reported by two of its prominent delegates (Laurel and Aruego )  who recounted in their published works how the delegates blocked the move to  subject the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, in  cases of invasion, insurrection or rebellion, to the approval of the National  Assembly, but did nothing to block, and allowed, the grant of the power, including  that to declare martial law, to the President as Commander-in-Chief of the  Armed Forces. What is evident from this  incident is that when it comes to the suspension of the privilege of the writ  of habeas corpus and establishment of martial law in case of imminent  danger of the contingencies mentioned therein, and the public safety requires  it, the clear intent was to exclusively vest in the President that power,  whereas Congress can only suspend under the Bill of Rights provision when there  is actual occurrence of these events for reasons already adverted to above. And  when martial law is proclaimed, the suspension of the privilege of the writ of  habeas corpus necessarily follows, for the greater power includes the less.  Nobody will ever doubt that there are greater restrictions to individual  liberty and freedom under martial law than under suspension of the privilege of  the writ of habeas corpus. In the former  he can even close the courts if necessary and establish in their place military  commissions. In the latter, the action  proceeds from the premise that the courts are open but cannot grant the writ. When the Constitution of 1935 was being framed, the prevailing  jurisprudence on the matter was that laid down in Barcelon vs . Baker, 5 Phil. 87, September 30, 1905 . In that case the question presented and  decided is identical to what is raised the petitioners here. This Court (1905) ruled that the judiciary  may not inquire into the facts and circumstances upon which the then Governor  General suspended the privilege of the writ under Section 5 of the Philippine  Bill of 1902, which granted him the same power now vested in the President, and  that the findings of the Governor General were ""final and conclusive""  upon the courts. Aware of this rule, the framers of the 1935 Constitution  granted to the President the powers now found in Article VII, Section 10,  paragraph 2, of the 1935 Constitution. On October 22, 1950, Proclamation No. 210 suspending the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus was issued by the late President Quirino . Assailed  before this Court in Montenegro vs . Castañeda and Balao , 91 Phil. 882, as unconstitutional and  unfounded, this Court said: ""And we agree with the Solicitor General that in the light of  the views of the United States Supreme Court thru Marshall, Taney and Story  quoted with approval in Barcelon vs . Baker (5  Phil. 87, pp. 98 and 100) the authority to decide whether the exigency has  arisen requiring suspension belongs to the President and 'his decision is final  and conclusive' upon the courts and upon all other persons."" But in Lansang vs . Garcia,  L-33964, decided December 11, 1971, 42 SCRA, 448, this Court asserted the power  to inquire into the constitutional sufficiency of the factual bases supporting  the President's action in suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus  under Proclamation No. 889, dated August 21, 1971. In departing from the rule established in the  Baker and Castañeda cases, this Court said: ""The weight of Barcelon vs .  Baker, as a precedent, is diluted by two (2) factors, namely: (a) it relied  heavily upon Martin vs . Mott involving the U.S. President's power to call  out the militia , which, he being the commander-in-chief of all the armed  forces, may be exercised to suppress or prevent any lawless violence, even  without invasion, insurrection or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, and  is, accordingly, much broader than his authority to suspend the privilege of  the writ of habeas corpus , jeopardizing as the latter does individual  liberty; and (b) the privilege had been suspended by the American  Governor-General, whose act, as representative of the Sovereign, affecting the  freedom of its subjects, can hardly be equated with that of the President of  the Philippines dealing with the freedom of the Filipino people, in whom  sovereignty resides, and from whom all government authority emanates . The  pertinent ruling in the Montenegro case was based mainly upon the Barcelon case, and, hence, cannot have more weight than the  same. . .” I maintain that we should return to the rule in the Baker and Castañeda cases and jettison the Lansang doctrine which denies the grant of full, plenary and unrestricted power to the  President to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and declare  martial law. This denial of unrestricted  power is not in keeping with the intent and purpose behind the constitutional  provision involved. The Act of Congress of 1795 involved in Martin & Mott (12  Wheat 19 (1827)) which is the main prop of the Baker case, held inapplicable in Lansang case, provided: ""That whenever the United States shall be invaded or be in  imminent danger of invasion from any foreign nation or Indian tribe, it shall  be lawful for the President of the United States to call forth such number of  the militia of the State or States most convenient to the place of danger or  scene of action, as he may judge necessary to repel such invasion . . ."" The distinction made by this Court between the power of the  President to call out the militia and his power to suspend the privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus and declare martial law does not warrant a different  treatment. The important and decisive  point to consider is that both powers are expressly conferred upon the  President by the same Section, exercisable only upon the existence of certain  facts and situations. Under the 1935 Constitution (Article VII, Section 10,  paragraph 2,) both powers are embraced in the President's power as  Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. The Baker decision should not have been emasculated by comparing  the position then of the Governor General ""as the representative of the  Sovereign"" in relation to the Filipinos who were its  ""subjects"". Under prevailing  conditions and democratic principles, there would be greater justification for  relying on the, judgment of the President of the Philippines who is the chosen  representative of the Filipino people and hence more authoritative in speaking  for the nation than on that of an American Governor General who then  personified the burden of an imposed sovereignty upon us. And as the Executive of this Government who  is charged with the responsibility of executing the laws, he is as much a  guardian of the rights and liberties of the people as any court of justice. To judicially undercut the force and efficacy  of the Baker and Montenegro doctrine is to ride rough shod over the intent of  the framers of the 1935 Constitution. Parenthetically, it may be stated that the Commander-in-­Chief clause  was retained in the 1973 Constitution. Although the Lansang case tried to  cushion the blow administered to the constitutional provision involved by  adopting the test of ""reasonableness"" in the exercise of the  President's power, without meaning to substitute its judgment for that of the  President, yet the effect of the ruling is so far reaching that it may lead to  a serious confrontation between the Courts and the President. The power to inquire into the constitutional  sufficiency of the factual bases of the habeas corpus proclamation (grounds for  the issuance of which are the same as those for martial law) presupposes the  power, to know what are the facts to be tested by the  constitutional provision . This is  the essence of an inquiry; the determination of the constitutional sufficiency  of those facts simply follows. Suppose  this Court says they are not sufficient to justify martial law and the  President says they are because the evidence on which he acted shows the  existence of invasion, insurrection or rebellion, or the imminent danger  thereof, what will happen? The outcome  is too unpleasant to contemplate. Let us  not try to repeat in our country what transpired between President Lincoln and  Chief Justice Taney when the latter issued a writ of habeas corpus to set free  one held by the military and President Lincoln practically said: ""Taney has issued his writ. Let him enforce it"". Ex parte Merryman , 17 Fed. Casa 144  (No. 9487) (C.C.D. Md. 1861): President Lincoln, in the face of the grave danger then to the  nation, simply ignored it and nothing could be done about it. The test of reasonableness, or absence of arbitrariness in the  exercise of the presidential power, is all a play of words. The determination of the reasonableness of  the act of the President calls for a consideration of the availability and  choice of less drastic alternatives for the President to take, and when that is  done the Court will in effect be substituting its judgment for that of the  President. If the Court were to limit  its powers to ascertaining whether there is evidence to support the exercise of  the President's power, without determining whether or not such evidence is  true, we would have the curious spectacle of this Court having no choice but to  give its imprimatur to the validity of the presidential proclamation, as it did  in the Lansang case where it merely accepted the  reports of the military on the facts relied upon by the President in issuing  Proclamation No. 889, without judicially determining whether or not the  contents of those reports were true. In  so doing, this Court simply displayed the miserable limits of its competence  for having no means for checking whether or not those facts are true. It would have been more in keeping with the  dignity, prestige and proper role of this Court to simply read and consider the  bases for the suspension as stated in the various "" whereases ""  of the Proclamation, and then determine whether they are in conformity with the  constitution. This to me is the extent  of its power. To transcend it is to  usurp or interfere with the exercise of a presidential prerogative. This Court should not spurn the reminder that it is not the  source of the panacea for all ills affecting the body politic (Vera vs . Avelino , 77 Phil. 192). When a particular cure can come only from the political department, it  should refrain from injecting itself into the clash of political forces  contending for the settlement of a public question. The determination of when and how a  constitutionally granted presidential power should be exercised calls for the  strict observance of the time-honored principle of the separation of powers and  respect for a co-equal, coordinate and independent branch of the  Government. This is the basic foundation  of the rule governing the handling of a political question that is beyond  judicial competence ( Alejandrino vs . Quezon , 46 Phil. 35; Cabili vs .  Francisco, G.R. No. L­-4638, May 8, 1951; Baker vs .  Carr, 360 U.S. p. 186; 82 S. Ct. Rep. 69; 7 L. Ed. 2nd, 663). It is high time to reexamine and repudiate  the Lansang doctrine and give the President the sole  authority to decide when and how to exercise his own constitutional  powers. A return to the sanity and  wisdom of the Baker and Castañeda doctrine and a  realization that judicial power is unwelcome when a question presents  attributes that render it incapable of judicial determination, because the  power to decide it devolves on another entity, is urgently needed. It is worthwhile recalling what this Court in  its sobriety and wisdom, unperturbed by the formidable turmoils ,  the fierce passions and emotions and the stresses of our times, said in the  Baker case: (The term ""Governor  General"" should read ""President""). ""If the investigation and findings of the President, or the  Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine Commission, are not  conclusive and final as against the judicial department of the Government, then  every officer whose duty it is to maintain order and protect the lives and  property of the people may refuse to act, and apply to the judicial department  of the Government for another investigation and conclusion concerning the same  conditions, to the end that they may be protected against civil actions  resulting from illegal acts. ""Owing to conditions at times, a state of insurrection,  rebellion or invasion may arise suddenly and may jeopardize the very existence  of the State. Suppose, for example, that  one of the thickly populated Governments situated near this Archipelago,  anxious to extend its power and territory, should suddenly decide to invade these  Islands, and should, without warning, appear in one of the remote harbors with  a powerful fleet and at once begin to land troops. The governor or military commander of the  particular district or province notifies the Governor-General by telegraph of  this landing of troops and that the people of the district are in collusion  with such invasion. Might not the  Governor-General and the Commission accept this telegram as sufficient evidence  and proof of the facts communicated and at once take steps, even to the extent  of suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , as might  appear to them to be necessary to repel such invasion? It seems that all men interested in the  maintenance and stability of the Government would answer this question in the affirmative ... ""But suppose some one, who has been arrested in the district  upon the ground that his detention would assist in restoring order and in  repelling the invasion, applies for the writ of habeas corpus, alleging that no  invasion actually exists; may the judicial department of the Government call  the officers actually engaged in the field before it and away from their posts  of duty for the purpose of explaining and furnishing proof to it concerning the  existence or nonexistence of the facts proclaimed to exist by the legislative  and executive branches of the State? If  so, then the courts may effectually tie the hands of the executive, whose  special duty it is to enforce the laws and maintain order, until the invaders  have actually accomplished their purpose. The interpretation contended for here by the applicants, so pregnant  with detrimental results, could not have been intended by the Congress of the  United States when it enacted the law. ""It is the duty of the legislative branch of the Government to  make such laws and regulations as will effectually conserve peace and good  order and protect the lives and property of the citizens of the State. It is the duty of the Governor-General to  take such steps as he deems wise and necessary for the purpose of enforcing  such laws. Every delay and hindrance and obstacle which prevents a strict  enforcement of laws under the conditions mentioned necessarily tends to  jeopardize public interests and the safety of the whole people. If the judicial department of the Government,  or any officer in the Government, has a right to contest the orders of the  President or of the Governor-General under the conditions above supposed,  before complying with such orders, then the hands of the President or the  Governor-General may be tied until the very object of the rebels or insurrectors or invaders has been accomplished. But it is urged that the President, or the  Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine Commission, might be  mistaken as to the actual conditions; that the legislative department — the  Philippine Commission — might, by resolution, declare after investigation, that  a state of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion exists, and that the public  safety requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus ,  when, as a matter of fact, no such Conditions actually existed; that the  President, or Governor-General acting upon the authority of the Philippine  Commission, might by proclamation suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus without there actually existing the conditions mentioned in the act of  Congress. In other words, the applicants  allege in their argument in support of their application for the writ of habeas  corpus , that the legislative and executive branches of the Government might  reach a wrong conclusion from their investigations of the actual conditions, or  might, through a desire to oppress and harass the people, declare that a state  of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion existed and that public safety required  the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus when actually and  in fact no such conditions did exist. We can not assume that the legislative  and executive branches will act or take any action based upon such motives. ""Moreover, it can not be assumed that the legislative and  executive branches of the Government, with all the machinery which those  branches have at their command for examining into the conditions in any part of  the Archipelago, will fail to obtain all existing information concerning actual  conditions. It is the duty of the executive branch of the Government to  constantly inform the legislative branch of the Government of the condition of  the Union as to the prevalence of peace or disorder. The executive branch of the Government,  through its numerous branches of the civil and military, ramifies every portion  of the Archipelago, and is enabled thereby to obtain information from every  quarter and corner of the State. Can the  judicial department of the Government, with its very limited machinery for the  purpose of investigating general conditions, be any more, sure of ascertaining  the true conditions, throughout the Archipelago, or in any particular district,  than the other branches of the Government? We think not."" C. THE CONCLUSION The resolution of the question of validity of Proclamation No.  1081 and all acts done under it, by delving into the sufficiency of the grounds  on which the declaration of martial law is premised, involves a political  question. Whether or not there is  constitutional basis for the President's action is for him to decide  alone. I take it for a fact that he is  not an irresponsible man and will act reasonably and wisely, and not  arbitrarily. No President in his right  mind will proclaim martial law without any basis at all but merely to fight the  hobgoblins and monsters of his own imagination. In the exercise of that power this Court should not interfere or take  part in any manner, shape or form, as it did in the Lansang case. When this Court required the Army  officers, who furnished the President with the facts on which he acted, to  present proofs to establish the basis of the habeas corpus suspension, this  Court practically superimposed itself on the executive by inquiring into the  existence of the facts to support his action. This, is indeed unfortunate. To inquire is to know the facts as basis of  action. To inquire is to decide, and to  decide includes the power to topple down or destroy what has been done or  erected. This is the ultimate effect of  the Lansang doctrine. When the security and existence of the state is jeopardized by  sophisticated, clandestine and overseas means of destruction and subversion;  when open avowals of attempts to dismember the Philippines are politically and  financially encouraged and supported by foreign powers; when the advocates of a  sinister political and social ideology are openly storming even the bastions of  military power and strength with the use of smuggled arms furnished by those  who wish this nation ill, let us leave to the Executive the unhampered  determination of the occasion for the exercise of his power, as well as the  choice of the weapons for safeguarding the nation. This Court should not, by a  process of subtle reasoning and rhetorical display of legal erudition, stand on  the way to effective action by virtually crippling him. Instead, it should be a  rock of refuge and strength for those who are called upon to do battle against  the forces of devastating iconoclasm and ruthless vandalism that ruled our  streets, our public squares and our schools before the establishment of martial  law. Instead of imposing cramping  restrictions on the executive and thereby giving the enemy aid and comfort,  this Court should allow the political department a full and wide latitude of action. It follows that all orders, decrees or acts of the President  under the Martial Law Proclamation, including those of the respondent Secretary  of National Defense as his authorized representative, are valid and  binding. The people have ratified those  acts by the adoption and ratification of the New Constitution as proclaimed by  the President on January 17, 1973, and by the Referendum held on July 27-28,  1973. For us to declare them valid in  our decision now has become merely an anti-climax after we have decided in the Javellana case that the people have ratified and accepted  the New Constitution and there remains no more judicial obstacle to its  enforcement. Consequently, the arrest and detention of the petitioners,  including their further detention after the ratification and acceptance of the  New Constitution, and even up to the present, are valid and constitutional. The  duration of their detention, especially as regards petitioner Jose W. Diokno , is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of  the President. As to petitioner Benigno S. Aquino , Jr., his  detention is no longer open to question as formal charges of subversion, murder  and illegal possession of firearms have been filed against him with the proper  Military Commission. D. THE JUDGMENT By this separate opinion I might incur the displeasure of my  senior brethren who conceived and labored in bringing forth the Lansang decision which I am openly advocating to be  discarded because this Court practically interfered with the exercise of a  purely executive power under the guise of inquiring into the constitutional  sufficiency of the factual bases of the habeas corpus proclamation. By requiring the representatives .of the President to present evidence to show the reasonable exercise of his  power, I repeat that this Court trenched upon a constitutionally granted power  of the President. In expressing my  honest thoughts on a matter that I believe is of supreme importance to the  safety and security of the nation, I did so unmindful of the possible  condemnation of my colleagues and fearless of the judgment of history. FOR ALL THE FOREGOING , I vote to dismiss all petitions. SEPARATE OPINION FERNANDEZ, J. : I PROLOGUE I have decided to write this Separate Opinion even before the  main opinion has been written, for no other cases in the history of the  Republic have assumed such transcendental importance as the cases which directly  arose out of the proclamation of martial law on September 21, 1972 . No other cases presented before this Court have aroused such widespread  attention, speculation, controversy, and concern. And in the language of one of the  petitioners, ""the decision in these case(s), whatever it may be, will be  cited in history books many, many years from now. And it will be quoted wherever lovers of  freedom ask the question — What did the Court do in that difficult hour?"" Our decision in the various petitions now before this Tribunal  like Our decision in the Ratification Cases (L-­36142, Javellana vs . The Executive Secretary, et al.; L-36165, Roxas ,  et al., vs . Melchor , etc., et al.; L-36232, Monteclaro , et al. vs . The Honorable Executive  Secretary, et al.), must uphold the validity of constitutionalism in our  country and our steadfast adherence to the Rule of Law. The decision should set the pattern and the  thrust of Our continuous effort to locate that elusive boundary between  individual liberty and public order. It  should reconcile the claims to individual or civil rights with the equally and,  at times, even more compelling needs of community existence in a spirit of  Constitutionalism and adherence to the Rule of Law. Through our New Constitution, the Delegates to the Constitutional  Convention and the voters in the ratification referendum alike have given our  government a fresh mandate and new guidelines in the charting of a truly  independent existence and the emergence of a dynamic and progressive order. It is now the task of this Court to  concretize and make clearly visible the connecting links between the 1935  Constitution and the 1973 Constitution, and to consider the constitutionality  of the martial law proclamation (No. 1081) now being vehemently challenged in  these cases -- its constitutionality as initially proclaimed under the old  Constitution, and the constitutionality of its continuation which now falls  under the present Charter. It is also the function of this Tribunal to help give flesh and  substance to our people's aspirations for secure and self-sufficient if not  abundant existence even as justice, peace, liberty, and equality are guaranteed  and assured. It must strike the correct  balance, given specific times and circumstances, between the demands of public  or social order and equally insistent claims of individual liberty. The issues raised regarding the force and effectivit y of the 1973 Constitution have  been thoroughly discussed in other  cases. They should now be a settled  matter but have been raised anew. These  were discussed at length in the earlier stages of the instant petitions. The mass of pleadings and lengthy oral  arguments dwelt not only on the validity of Proclamation No. 1081 and the  legality of the arrest and detention of the petitioners but also on the effectivity of the new Constitution and other related  matters as right to counsel, jurisdiction of military tribunals, applications  for amnesty, visits of relatives, conditions inside the detention camp right to  withdraw the petition, and the like. While it is necessary to sift the basic issues from all secondary and  incidental matters, we must also touch on important related issues. It is imperative to declare what the  Constitution commands is the law on these issues. The average citizen, as a rule, is not very interested in the  detailed intricacies surrounding the resolution of constitutional  questions. He usually has strong views  on the final outcome of constitutional litigation but rarely bothers to inquire  into the labyrinthian facets of the case or the  detailed reasoning which usually supports the dispositive portion. It is not so with regard to these habeas corpus cases. The explosive potentialities of Our ruling  are known to everybody. The country  awaits Our decision with keen expectations. The grounds supporting the decision are a matter of public concern. The implications of these cases have been  speculated upon, although sometimes with limited comprehension and noticeable  lack of fairness, even in foreign countries. It, therefore, behooves the members of this Tribunal to render  their opinions, as much as possible, in terms and in a presentation that can be  understood by the people. In J.M. Tuason and Co., Inc. vs.  Land Tenure Administration , (31 SCRA 413, 423) this Tribunal stated that  ""as the Constitution is not primarily a lawyer's document, it being  essential for the rule of law to obtain that it should ever be present in the  people's consciousness, its language as much as possible should be understood  in the sense they have in common use."" In this case, We should go one step further. We should not limit Ourselves to looking at  the words of the Constitution as ordinary and simple language but Our reasoning  in the decision itself should be frank and explicit. Our task is not a mere matter of  constitutional construction and interpretation. Through its decision, this Court should also speak directly to the  average layman, to the common people. II THE MARTIAL LAW PROCLAMATION On September 23, 1972 the President announced that, on September   21, 1972 or two days earlier, he had, pursuant to Proclamation No.  1081, declared a state of martial law in the Philippines . The President cited and detailed many acts of  insurrection and rebellion against the government of the Republic of the Philippines committed by lawless elements and various front organizations in order to seize  political and state power. Proclamation  No. 1081 concludes — NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the  Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested upon me by Article VII, Section 10,  paragraph (2) of the Constitution, do hereby place the entire Philippines as  defined in Article 1, Section 1 of the Constitution under martial law and, in  my capacity as their commander-in-chief, do hereby command the armed forces of  the Philippines, to maintain law and order throughout the Philippines, prevent  or suppress all forms of lawless violence as well as any act of insurrection or  rebellion and to enforce obedience to all the laws and decrees, orders and  regulations promulgated by me personally or upon my direction. In addition, I do hereby order that all persons presently detained,  as well as all others who may hereafter be similarly detained for the crimes  committed in furtherance or on the occasion thereof, or incident thereto, or in  connection therewith, for crimes against public order, crimes involving  usurpation of authority, rank, title and improper use of names, uniforms, and  insignia, crimes committed by public officer, and for such other crimes as will  be enumerated in Orders that I shall subsequently promulgate, as well as crimes  as a consequence of any violation of any decree, order or regulation  promulgated by me personally or promulgated upon my direction shall be kept  under detention until otherwise ordered released by me or by my duly designated  representative. x x x x x III ARREST OF THE PETITIONERS Under a state of martial law, petitioners or the persons in whose  behalf petitions for writs of habeas corpus have been filed were on  various dates arrested and detained. The  orders of arrest were premised on General Order No. 2 of the President dated September 22, 1972 [1] which was amended by General Order No. 2-A, on September 26, 1972 . General Order No. 2-A reads: Pursuant to Proclamation Order No. 1081, dated September 21, 1972 , and in my capacity as Commander-in-Chief of all the Armed  Forces of the Philippines . I hereby order you as Secretary of National  Defense to forthwith arrest or cause the arrest and take into your custody the  individuals named in the attached lists for being participants or for having  given aid and comfort in the conspiracy to seize political and state power in  the country and to take over the government by force, the extent of which has  now assumed the proportion of an actual war against our people and our legitimate government and in order  to prevent them from further committing acts that are inimical or injurious to  our people, the government and our national interest, and to hold said  individuals until otherwise so ordered by me or by my duly designated  representative. Likewise, I do hereby order you to arrest or cause the arrest and  take into custody and to hold them until otherwise ordered released by me or by  my duly designated representative: 1. Such persons as may have committed crimes and  offenses in furtherance or on the  occasion of or incident to or in connection with the crimes of  insurrection or rebellion as defined in Articles 134 to 138 of the Revised Penal Code, and other crimes against public  order as defined in Articles 146, 147,  148, 149, 151, 153, 154, 155, and 156 of the same Code; 2. Such persons who may have committed crimes  against national security and the laws of the nation, as enumerated and defined  in Title I of the Revised Penal Code; xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx Arrests and detentions under a martial law proclamation are not  necessarily limited to those who have actually committed crimes and  offenses. More specifically, those  arrested and taken into custody under General Order No. 2-A fall under three  general groups: 1. Those who appear to have actually committed crimes and offenses and who should be  charged and punished for such crimes and offenses pursuant to our penal laws; 2. Those who have been arrested not to make them  account for crimes and offenses but to prevent them from committing acts  inimical or injurious to the objectives of a martial law proclamation; and 3. Those who appear to have actually committed  crimes and offenses but whose prosecution and punishment is deferred because the preventive nature of their detention is, for the moment, more important than their punishment for violating the laws of the land. Criminal charges have been filed against petitioner Benigo S. Aquino , Jr., and he  therefore, may fall under Group No. 1 and the ""preventive"" aspect of  Group No. 3. It is true that he questions the validity of the charges, raises  as an issue the deprivation of fundamental rights of an accused, and challenges  the jurisdiction of a military commission to try him. However, determination of these questions is  properly for another proceeding and another decision. For purposes of these habeas corpus petitions, he and many others similarly situated may fall under Groups 1 and 3. Petitioner Jose W. Diokno can fall  under Group 2 and Group No. 3, as far as the record indicates. Thus, there may be persons arrested pursuant  to General Order No. 2 who may  fall under the second group but against whom charges could be filed as under  the third group. They have not been  charged for reasons obviously related to national security. The administration may have determined that,  in the light of the martial law situation, it is neither wise nor expedient to  file such charges now. The constitutionality of the arrest of those arrested under Group  No 1 cannot be questioned. They have  committed a crime and therefore can be ordered arrested and detained. The constitutionality of the arrest of those arrested under Group  Nos. 2 and 3, under martial law finds support in  the book of Justice Fernando and Senator Tañada ; the  pertinent part of said book reads as follows: Once martial law has been declared, arrest may be necessary not  so much for punishment but by way of precaution to stop disorder. As long as such arrest are made in good faith and in the honest belief they  are needed to maintain order, the President, as Commander-in-Chief, cannot  thereafter after he is out of office,  be subjected to an action on the  ground that he had no reasonable ground for his belief. When it comes  to a decision by the head of the State upon  a matter involving its life, the  ordinary rights of individual, must  yield to what he deems the necessities of the moment. Public danger  warrants the substitution of executive process. This is admitted with regard to killing men in the actual clash of arms and the same is true of  temporary detention to prevent apprehended harm. Good faith and honest belief is the necessity  of the detention to maintain order thus  furnishes a good defense to any claim for liability. ( Tañada and Fernando, Constitution of the Philippines .  Vol. II, pp. 1013-1014, 1953 ed.) IV THE  PETITIONS FOR WRITS OF HABEAS CORPUS (a) The Grounds Therefor : Petitions for writs of habeas corpus were accordingly  filed in this Court by or in behalf of the arrested and detained individuals. The petitions contain substantially similar  grounds and prayers. For instance, in G.R. No. L-35539, Carmen I. Diokno pressed for the urgent and  immediate release of Senator J ose W. Diokno from the custody of either the respondents,  their agents, instruments, auxiliaries or servants. It is alleged that the respondents unlawfully  or illegally and without any valid authority whatsoever, in violation of the  petitioner's rights as a citizen of the Republic, seized his person from his  residence and moved him to a place of confinement and detention. The petition also alleges that no charges  have been filed against Jose W. Diokno for committing  or having committed insurrection or rebellion or subversion and that the  memorandum directing his arrest is neither an order of arrest nor a warrant of  arrest. The petition in G.R. No. L-35546 alleges that petitioners Benigno S. Aquino , Jr., Ramon V. Mitra , Jr., Francisco S. Rodrigo, and Napoleon Rama have been illegally detained and unlawfully deprived  of their personal liberty beyond the period authorized by law without any  formal complaint for any specific offense having been instituted against them  before our courts of law and without any judicial writ or order, having been  issued authorizing their confinement. It  is alleged that the petitioners have not committed any crime nor violated any  law, rule or regulation whether individually or in collaboration with other  person or persons for which they may be detained and deprived of their personal  liberty without any formal charge or judicial warrant. A common allegation in the various petitions challenges the  validity of Presidential Proclamation No. 1081. It is asserted that Proclamation No. 1081 declaring martial law is  illegal and unconstitutional and, therefore, null and void because the  conditions under which martial law may be declared by the President do not  exist. The petition in G.R. No. L-35546  states that assuming argumenti gratis that the conditions for the valid exercise of the extraordinary power to  declare martial law exist, Proclamation No. 1081 and Presidential Decrees and  Orders issued pursuant thereto are unconstitutional and illegal in extent and  scope because they deprive the Supreme Court of its constitutional power and  authority to determine the constitutionality, legality and validity of the  decrees, orders, rules and regulations issued pursuant to the  proclamation. It is alleged that the  proclamation is unconstitutional and illegal because it divests and ousts the  civil courts throughout the Philippines of the jurisdiction to decide and punish certain offenses under the existing  laws of the land. The petition  emphasizes that civil courts continue to remain open and have in fact never  ceased to function. The petition challenges the validity of Proclamation No. 1081 because it  grants to the President powers which are otherwise vested by the Constitution  in other departments of the Government. Corollary to the above allegations G.R. No. L-35546, is the  allegation of petitioners Veronica L. Yuyitung and  Tan Chin Hian in G.R. No. L-35556 that assuming  without admitting the validity of Proclamation No. 1081, the issuance of such a  proclamation is not a valid justification to arrest any person whimsically or  arbitrarily or without the necessary basis or foundation inherent in proper  arrest or detention. The petition in G.R. No. 35547 alleges that petitioner E.  Voltaire Garcia II has not committed the crimes of insurrection, rebellion or  subversion nor any crime similar thereto nor any crime at all. It states that his continued illegal  detention prevents him from performing his function as member of the  Constitutional Convention and, therefore, deprives his district of  representation which is obviously against public policy and public  interest. The petition asks the Supreme  Court to take judicial notice of the fact that there was no invasion,  insurrection, or rebellion or imminent danger thereof before and/or after the  date of Proclamation No. 1081 that may require for the public safety the placing  of any part of the country under martial law. Reiterating the allegations in the other petitions, it outlines how,  throughout the length and breadth of the country especially in the Greater  Manila area, all, executive offices are functioning in complete normalcy; how  all courts from the lowest municipal courts to the Supreme Court are in full  operation; and how the different legislative bodies from barrio councils up to  Congress are likewise functioning smoothly according to law. Petitioner Ernesto Rondon in G.R. No. L-35573 alleges that pursuant to  Proclamation No. 1081 the  President issued General Order. No. 3 which creates military tribunals to take  jurisdiction over certain acts and crimes to the exclusion of civil  courts. The petition, alleges that the  creation of such military tribunals and the vesting thereof with judicial  functions are null and void because civil courts are , open and functionin g . It questions the intent to try the petitioner  before the military tribunals for any crime which the respondents may impute to  him. The petitioner alleges that he has  not engaged in any of the criminal activities defined in Proclamation No. 1081, that, at best, he is only a critic of the policies of the  Government and, at worst, a civilian citizen amenable to the processes of  civilian law, if at all he has committed any offense. (b) Present Status of  Petitioners : As things now  stand, the different petitioners may be divided into four (4) groups: 1. Some petitioners like Veronica L. Yuvitung ,  Tan Chin Hian , Bren Guiao , Hernando J. Abaya , Ernesto  Granada, Luis Beltran, Ruben Cusipag and Willie Baun have already been released from custody of the  respondents and are no longer under detention. These petitioners earlier filed motions to withdraw their cases and the  Court readily approved the withdrawal of the petitions. 2. Some petitioners like Joaquin V. Roces , Teodoro M. Locsin , Sr.  Rolando Fadul , Rosalind Galang ,  Go Eng Guan, Maximo V. Soliven , Renato Constantino , Luis R.  Mauricio, Juan L. Mercado, Roberto Ordoñez and Manuel Almario have likewise been released from respondents  custody and are also no longer detained. However, after an initial period of silence following their release, the  petitioners have manifested that they have only been conditionally released  subject to various conditions and continuing restrictions thus implying they  expect a decision on their petitions. Petitioner Francisco S. Rodrigo has also filed a manifestation stating  that while he was released from detention at Fort Bonifacio , Quezon City, on December 5, 1972, his release was  conditional and subject to certain restrictions. His manifestation was filed for the purpose  of showing that insofar as he is concerned, his petition for habeas corpus is not  moot and academic. Petitioner Francisco  S. Rodrigo is, therefore, asking this Court to render a decision on his  petition for a writ of habeas corpus. 3. On the other hand, petitioner Jose W. Diokno was under detention until very recently. For reasons which will be discussed later, he has, however, asked for  and insisted upon the withdrawal of his petition in spite of the fact that he  is under detention. Before this opinion  could be promulgated, however, he has been ordered released by the President on  the occasion of His Excellency's birthday, September 11, 1974 , together with some other detainees  under martial law. 4. Petitioner Benigno S. Aquino , Jr. is still under detention. Charges have been filed before a military  commission for various crimes and offenses but the petitioner challenges the  jurisdiction of military courts. He has  not filed any motion to withdraw his petition. Based on his pleadings and his challenge to the jurisdiction of military  tribunals, the petitioner states that it is incumbent upon this Court to rule  upon the merits of the petition. He  wants information filed before civilian courts and invokes constitutional  rights to free him from military detention. Petitioner Benigno S. Aquino Jr., is insistent that this Court render a decision on his petition for a writ  of habeas corpus. V ANSWER OF RESPONDENTS: THE ISSUES The answer of the respondents states that on September 21, 1972 , the President of the Philippines ,  in the exercise of powers vested in him by Article VII, Section 10, paragraph 2 of the Constitution,  issued Proclamation No. 1081 placing the entire Philippines under martial law. All the acts  questioned by the petitioners are justified by orders and instructions of the  President issued pursuant to the proclamation of martial law. The main question that confronts the Tribunal  is therefore, the validity of Proclamation No.1081. If it is tainted with unconstitutionality,  then all the acts taken pursuant to the proclamation are void. It will then follow that the arrest and  detentions of the petitioners are void. On the other hand, if the proclamation of martial law is  sustained, we still have to determine its scope and effects. We must answer these questions: May we inquire into the validity of its  continuation? Is a suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus  automatically included in a proclamation of martial law? Other questions also arise which, however, need be decided by Us  only in a general manner in the present cases. May the Commander-in-Chief issue orders with the force and effect of  legislation? May such legislation cover subjects which are not directly related  to the conquest of the particular crisis? In other words, does the proclamation of martial law give the President  authority to pass legislation not directly related to invasion, insurrection,  rebellion, or imminent danger thereof? If civilian courts are open and functioning, may the President issue  decrees and orders which transfer some of the jurisdiction to military  tribunals? Incidental issues have also been raised in the light of the main  issue of martial law. One is no longer  before this Court but may be mentioned in passing. The 1973 Constitution  increased the composition of the Court from eleven (11) to fifteen (15). At a time when there were only nine  (9) members carried over from the old Court, may these nine members — the  Acting Chief Justice and eight members — validly hear a constitutional  issue? Is there a quorum under Article  X. Section 2 (2)? which reads: [2] All cases involving the  constitutionality of a treaty, executive agreement, or law shall be heard and  decided by the Supreme Court en banc , and no treaty, executive  agreement, or law may be declared unconstitutional without the concurrence of  at least ten Members. All other cases  which under its rules are required to be heard en banc shall be decided  with the concurrence of at least eight members. We now have a Chief Justice and eleven members so the problem of  a quorum is solved. Another incidental issue is the power of this Court to inquire  into the conditions of detention of petitioners. And still another issue is  whether one of the petitioners may, at a time when a decision is ready to be  promulgated, withdraw his petition and avoid a decision on the issues he has  raised. VI ON PETITIONER DIOKNO'S MOTION TO WITHDRAW The first issue to resolve is an incidental but important  one. It is also the most recent. (a) Arguments Pro and  Con : In a Motion to Withdraw dated December 29,1973 , petitioner Jose W. Diokno asked leave of court to withdraw the petition for habeas corpus filed in  his behalf. He asked for the withdrawal  of the main petition other pleadings filed in the case. The reason given for the withdrawal was  ""First, though I am convinced beyond any nagging doubt that we are on the  side of right and reason, law and justice, I am equally convinced that we  cannot reasonably expect either right or reason, law or justice to prevail in  my case ... (and) Second, in view of the new oath that its members have taken  the present Supreme Court is a new Court functioning under a new Constitution,  different from the Court under which I applied for my release. I was willing to be judged by the old Court  under the old Constitution but not by the new Court under new Constitution  because as Albert Camus ' judge penitent said in the  novel 'The Fall': 'he who clings to a  law does not fear the judgment that puts him in his place within an order he  believes in. But the keenest of human  torments is to be judged without law."" On being required to comment on the petitioner's motion to  withdraw, the Solicitor General stated that the petitioner * should  not be allowed to remove his case from this Court. Three reasons were given: (a) that the charge is unfair to the Supreme  Court and its members; (b) that it is untrue and (c) that in the main, it is  contemptuous. The Solicitor General  disputed as unfair, the charge that justice cannot be expected from the Supreme  Court. He pointed out that the Supreme  Court did not inject itself into t he  controversy but it was the petitioner who invoked the Court's jurisdiction not  only in this case but the plebiscite cases as well. The Solicitor General noted that the scorn  with which the Court is treated in the motion to withdraw stands in sharp contrast  with the praise lavished on it when petitioners began these proceedings. It may be noted that the Supreme Court was then characterized as  having the greatest credibility among the three branches of government. It was described as a dispenser of justice  and as the last citadel of their liberties. In his Memorandum, petitioner manifested and stressed the  importance of a decision — ""the decision in this case, whatever it may  be , will be cited in history books many, many years from now. And it will be quoted wherever lovers of  freedom ask the question ... What did the Court do in that difficult  hour?"" (Underscoring supplied). The petitioner further stated in the Memorandum that ""the  duty of this Court is awesome indeed. It  responsibility to Our people and to history is heavier and more enormous than  words and phrases can possibly describe."" In contrast to this insistence on a decision, a portion of the  motion to withdraw cited by the respondents may be repeated: (I)t seems to me that our people have the right to expect members  of the highest court of the land to display a conscience more sensitive, a  sense of mental honesty more consistent than those generally displayed in the  market place. And it has pained me to note that, in swearing to support the new  'Constitution', the five members of the Court who had held that it had not been  validly ratified, have not fulfilled our expectations. I do not blame them. I do not know what I would have done in their  place. But, at the same time, I cannot  continue to entrust my case to them; and I have become thoroughly convinced  that our quest for justice in my case is futile. (p. 6). Issue was also taken by the respondents with the petitioner's  charge that despite the finding of a majority that the new Constitution had not  been validly ratified, the Court nonetheless dismissed the petitions seeking to  stop the enforcement of the Constitution. The allegation that the justices of this Court took an oath to support  the Constitution because they had been allowed to continu e in office was challenged as false by  the respondents. The third ground for the respondents' opposition to the motion to  withdraw is the allegedly contemptuous nature of the motion. The Comment states that attacks on the Court  are most serious; none of those made in the past has put the court's integrity  and capacity for justice in serious question as much as the petitioner's motion  to withdraw. According to the Solicitor  General, the charge in the case at bar goes to the very foundation of our  system of justice and the respect that is due to it, that it is subversive of  public confidence in the impartiality and independence of courts and tends to  embarrass the administration of justice. The Solicitor General manifested that ""we cannot shape the world of  the Supreme Court as we want to see it and, later seeing the world of reality,  lash at the Supreme Court for betraying our illusions."" In succeeding pleadings, petitioner Diokno pressed his motion to withdraw with even greater vigor. Counsel for petitioners stated that the  so-called charge ""unfair to the Court and its members, untrue, and  contemptuous"" — was never made at all and that the Solicitor General was  putting up a strawman and proceeding to demolish it. In a forty-six (46) page Reply, he pointed out that the factual bases  for deciding to withdraw the case have not been specifically denied, as indeed  they are undeniable. It should be noted,  however, that the cited factual bases go into the very merits of the petition  for the writ of habeas corpus : (1) On the question of the validity of ratification, six (6)  members of the Court held that the proposed Constitution was not validly  ratified. (2) On the question of acquiescence by the Filipino people, only a minority of four (4) justices held  there was acquiescence, two (2) holding that there was no acquiescence, and  four (4) holding they had no means of knowing to the point of judicial  certainty, whether the people have accepted the Constitution. (3) The Court did not rule that the ""new Constitution""  was in effect. (4) The ratification cases were nevertheless dismissed. The petitioner added ""undeniable facts"": (1) The petition for habeas corpus was filed September 23, 1972 while the ratification cases  were filed January 20 and 23, 1973. (2) From the filing of the petition to the date petitioner. Diokno asked his  counsel to withdraw the case, 460 days had elapsed. (3) On the date the reply was filed, 531 days had elapsed without  charges being filed or trial and conviction for any offense being held. (4) All the members of the old Court, who had taken an oath to  ""preserve and defend"" the 1935 Constitution, took an oath on October 29, 1973 to defend the  ""new Constitution"". In disputing the Solicitor General's charge that the Supreme  Court is treated with scorn in the Motion to Withdraw, the petitioner stated  that the tone of the motion may be one of dismay or frustration but certainly  not of scorn. The petitioner called the  charge gratuitous and totally bare of foundation. The petitioner also pointed out that there could be no contempt  of court in the motion to withdraw because the factual bases of his letter are  indisputable and the motion comes under the protection of the constitutional  right to a fair hearing. He invoked his  right to free expression as a litigant and stressed that a citizen of the  Republic may express himself thoughtfully sincerely and reputably without fear  of reprisal. The petitioner also pointed  out that both principle and precedent justify grant of the motion to withdraw. (b) My original  stand: Motion should be denied: Reasons: My present stand: In view  of the release of Diokno before this opinion could be  promulgated, I now vote to grant his motion to withdraw his petition the same  having become moot and academic. But, I would like to discuss the merits of the motion if only to  establish guidelines for similar cases that may arise in the future. As a general rule, the right of the plaintiff to dismiss his  action with the consent of the Court is universally recognized. If the plaintiff believes that the action he  has commenced in order to enforce a right or to rectify a wrong is no longer  necessary or he later discovers that the right no longer exists, he should be  allowed to withdraw his case. If in the  course of litigation, he finds out that the course of the action shall be  different from that he had intended, the general rule is that he should be  permitted to withdraw the same, subject to the approval of the Court. The plaintiff should not be required to continue the action when  it is not to his advantage to do so. Litigation should be discouraged and not  encouraged. Courts should not allow parties to litigate when they no longer  desire to litigate. It should be noted, however, that the Rules of Court do not allow  automatic approval of the plaintiff’s motion to dismiss after service of the  answer or of a motion for summary judgment. Under Rule 17, * once the  issues are joined, an action can be dismissed upon the plaintiff's instance  only upon order of the Court and upon such terms and conditions as the Court  deems proper. The requirement in the Rules that dismissal is discretionary upon  the Court is not without significance. In fact, the petitioner does not deny  the authority of the Court to reject his motion as long as there are reasons  for such rejection. He is simply arguing  that there is no valid reason to deny the motion thus implying that a denial  would, in effect, be an abuse in the exercise of a discretionary power. In the Court's deliberations, the view was advanced that  petitioner's motion for withdrawal made his confinement voluntary. I disagreed, for said motion, in the light of  the other pleadings and memoranda submitted by him, can still be considered as  a protest against his confinement. In  other words, petitioner has not made any statement upon which we can base a  conclusion that he is agreeing voluntarily to his continued confinement and  thereby making his case moot and academic. I submit there can be no debate over the principle that the right  to withdraw a petition at this stage is not an absolute right. What faces this Court is not its power to  grant or deny the motion but whether there are sound reasons why the motion to  withdraw should be denied. If there are  no sound reasons, the motion should be granted. According to the petitioner, there are only two instances when a  Court may validly deny such w ithdrawal  — (1) When the withdrawal would irreparably injure other parties to  the case such as, for example, in class results, in probate proceedings, or in  ordinary civil actions when the  adverse party has pleaded a counterclaim  that cannot be decided without first deciding the main case; and (2) When the withdrawal would irreparably injure the public  interest by depriving the Court of the opportunity to prevent or to correct a  serious violation of the Constitution or of the laws. I am not prepared to accept the proposition or to render an  abstract opinion that there are indeed only two such exceptions. The infinite number of factual situations  that can come before this Court could conceivably add one or two or even more  exceptions. It would be imprudent or precipitate to make such a categorical  assertion. Were it not for the release  of Diokno , I would have pressed on my firm belief  that the importance of this case and the issues raised by the petitioner call  for denial of the motion to withdraw. The points ably raised by Solicitor General Estelito P. Mendoza and Assistant Solicitor General Vicente V. Mendoza, who have shown  remarkably splendid performance in shouldering almost entirely the government's  defense, against some of the country's most distinguished lawyers, notably  former Senator Lorenzo M. Tanada and a battery of  other lawyers whose names are a veritable list of ""Who is Who"" in the  legal profession, can be condensed into only one argument —the petitioners have  brought before this Court a case of such transcendental importance that it  becomes a duty to our legal institutions, to our people, and to posterity to  decide it. We must not leave the  resolution of such grave issues to a future day. Furthermore, among the present habeas corpus cases now  before this Court, the best forum for Our decision would have been the Diokno case for, before his release, he was the only  petitioner who was actually detained but without charges, while there are  already charges filed against Aquino , and with  respect to the others whose cases are still pending before Us, they are only  under detention within the Greater Manila area or are under community arrest. The petitioner seeks to distinguish his case from Krivenko vs. Register of Deeds , 79 Phil.  461. In that case, this Court ruled -- According to Rule 52, section 4, of the Rules of Court, it is  discretionary upon this Court to grant a withdrawal of appeal after the briefs  have been presented. At the time the  motion for withdrawal was filed in this case, not only had the briefs been  presented, but the case had already been voted and the majority decision was  being prepared. The motion for  withdrawal stated no reason whatsoever, and the Solicitor General was agreeable  to it. While the motion was pending in  this Court, came the new circular of the Department of Justice instructing all  register of deeds to accept for registration all transfers of residential lots  to aliens. The herein respondent- appellee was naturally one of the registers of deeds to  obey the new circular, as against his own stand in this case which had been  maintained by the trial court and firmly defended in this Court by the  Solicitor General. If we grant the  withdrawal, the result would be that petitioner-appellant Alexander A. Krivenko wins his case, not by a decision of this Court but  by the decision or circular of the Department of Justice, issued while this  case was pending before this Court. Whether or not this is the reason why  appellant seeks the withdrawal of his appeal and why the Solicitor General  readily agrees to that withdrawal is now immaterial. What is material and indeed very important,  is whether or not we should allow interference with the regular and complete  exercise by this Court of its constitutional functions, and whether or not  after having held long deliberations and after having reached a clear and  positive conviction as to what the constitutional mandate is, we may still  allow our conviction to be silenced, and the constitutional mandate to be  ignored or misconceived, with all the harmful consequences that might be  brought upon the national patrimony. For  it is but natural that the new circular be taken full advantage of by many with  the circumstance that perhaps the constitutional question may never come up  again before this court, because both vendors and the vendees will have no  interest but to uphold the validity of their transactions, and very unlikely  will the register of deeds venture to disobey the orders of their  superior. Thus the possibility for this  court to voice its conviction in a future case may be remote, with the result  that our indifference of today might signify a permanent offense to the Constitution.  (pp. 466-467) There are indeed certain differences between the facts of the Krivenko case and the facts of the current petitions. If the factual situations were completely similar, former Senator  Lorenzo M. Tan ada would have been the last person to insist of the Diokno motion for withdrawal. He was the Solicitor General in 1947. He is completely familiar with the  ramification of the Krivenko case. I cannot, however, agree  with counsel Tanada that the deviations from the Krivenko facts call for a different ruling in the instance  petitions. The Supreme Court has  grappled at length and in depth validity of the proclamation of martial  law. It has closely examined the  resultant curtailments of such liberties as the right to a writ of habeas  corpus or to freedom of expression. When it is on the verge of issuing a decision it is suddenly asked to  drop the case and the issues raised simply because the petitioner is no longer  interested in the decision. To my mind,  a granting of the motion would be recreancy and  unfaithfulness to the Court's sworn duties and obligations. As in the Krivenko case, the  reasons for the withdrawal are no longer significant. It is the non-silencing of this Court on  issues of utmost public importance which really matters. It is true that petitioner Diokno is alone in seeking withdrawal at the stage of the  case. The fact that a decision could  possibly still be rendered on remaining cases is, however, no justification to  grant the motion. The issue is whether  one or two or all of the petitioners may ask for a withdrawal of his or their  petitions and hope to bring about a non-decision on the issues because of the  rendering moot and academic of the case. My answer is categorically in the negative. In fact, even if the case is mooted at this  stage by the release of the petitioners, I would still vote for a decision on  the questions raised. This may be a simple motion for withdrawal. Yet, I see no difference in the need to  answer vital questions that have been presented. The public interest that is affected is  equally pressing and serious if the petitions are compared to instances in the  past when the Court insisted on rendering a decision. In fact, there is an even stronger need to  interpret the meaning of the constitutional provision in spite of urgings that  it should refrain from doing so. As early as 1937, this Court, speaking through justice Laurel in  People of the Philippine Island vs. Vera (65 Phil. 56, 94) emphatically  stated that when the country awaits a decision on an important constitutional  question, a relaxation of general rules is called for. A decision must issue. x x x All await  the decision of this Court on the constitutional question. Considering, therefore, the importance which  the instant case has assumed and to prevent multiplicity of suits, strong  reasons of public policy demand that the constitutionality of Act No. 4221 be  now resolved. x x x In Yu  Cong Eng vs . Trinidad , supra, an analogous  situation confronted us. We said: ""Inasmuch as the property and personal  rights of nearly twelve thousand merchants are affected by these proceedings,  and inasmuch as Act No. 2972 is a new law not yet interpreted by the courts, in  the interest of the public welfare and for the advancement of public policy, we  have determined to overrule the defense of want of jurisdiction in order that  we may decide the main issue. We have  here an extraordinary situation which calls for a relaxation of the general  rule."" Our ruling on this point was sustained by the Supreme Court of the United    States . A more binding authority in support of the view we have taken can not be  found. In the case of Avelino vs. Cuenco (83 Phil. 17), the Supreme Court had very sound  reasons to resolve on March 4, 1949 not to decide whether or not Senator Cuenco had validly been elected Senate President. The Court  ruled that the subject matter of the quo warranto proceeding to declare the petitioner the rightful President of the Philippine  Senate and to oust the respondent was not a matter for the Supreme Court in  view of the separation of powers doctrine, the political nature of the  controversy, and the constitutional grant to the Senate of the power to elect its own President. The power to elect its President should not  be interfered with nor taken over by the judiciary. On March 14, 1949 or only ten (10) days later, the  Court, by a majority of seven, decided to resolve the questions presented to  it. The Court could very well have  insisted on its earlier stand that it should render no decision. Election of the Senate President was still a  matter which only the Senate should decide. And yet, in the light of subsequent events which justified its  intervention, partly for the reasons stated in the March 4, 1949 resolution of the Court; and partly  because of the grounds stated in the various individual opinions. The Court was  constrained to declare positively that there was a quorum in the session where Cuenco was elected Acting Senate President. The Court decided to reverse a categorical  position taken only ten (10) days earlier. It is clear from the circumstances of the case that the Court was impelled by strong policy considerations to  make a definite pronouncement in the case in order to conform to substantial  justice and comply with the requirements of public interest. As pointed out by Justice Perfecto in his  concurring opinion. ""This case raises vital constitutional questions which  no one can settle or decide if this Court should refuse to decide them."" In Gonzales vs.  Commission on Elections . (27  SCRA 835, 853), the words of Justice Laurel were recalled in order to  overcome objections to an extended decision on a case which had become moot and  academic. ""In the course of the deliberations, a serious procedural  objection was raised by five members of the Court (Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices Reyes, Makalintal , Teehankee and Barredo .) It  is their view that respondent Commission on Elections not being sought to be  restrained from performing any specific act, this suit cannot be characterized  as other than a mere request for an advisory opinion. Such a view, from the remedial law  standpoint, has much to recommend it. Nonetheless, a majority would affirm the original stand that under the  circumstances, it could still rightfully be treated as a petition for  prohibition. ""The language of Justice Laurel fits the case: 'All await the decision of this Court on the  constitutional question. Considering,  therefore, the importance which the instant case has assumed and to prevent  multiplicity of suits, strong reasons of public policy demand that (its)  constitutionality x x x be  now resolved.' (65 Phil. 56, 94 (1937) Cf. Yu Cong Eng vs . Trinidad , 47 Phil. 385  (1926), 271 US 500; 70 Law ed., 1059). It may likewise be added that the exceptional character of the situation that confronts  us, the paramount public interest, and the undeniable necessity for a ruling,  the national elections being barely six months away, reinforce our stand. ""It would appear undeniable, therefore, that before us is an  appropriate invocation of our jurisdiction to prevent the enforcement of in  alleged unconstitutional statute. We are  left with no choice then we must  act on the matter. In De la Camara vs. Enage (41 SCRA,  1) this Court was similarly impelled to make a decision because of  strong policy considerations. A petition  to reduce the P1,195,200.00 bail imposed by the trial court had become moot and  academic. The petitioner had escaped  from the provincial jail. The Court  could no longer grant any relief. It,  however, decided the case ""to set forth anew the controlling and  authoritative doctrines that should be observed in fixing the amount of the  bail sought in order that full respect be accorded to such a constitutional  right:"" (at page 4). Education,  especially of trial judges, was the reason for answering the issues squarely. I would like to reiterate, however, that in view of the fact that  petitioner Diokno has been released on the occasion  of President Marcos' birthday (September 11), I now vote to grant the Diokno motion to withdraw his petition for a writ of habeas corpus , the same having become moot and academic. VII COURT'S DUTY TO DECIDE ALL IMPORTANT ISSUES — ON THE  PETITIONS OF THE PETITIONERS But as already stated under the topic IV (b) ""Present Status  of the Petitioners"", many of them, notably Aquino and Rodrigo, still insist on a d ecision.  This we must now do, for the resolution of the controversy in favor of the  petitioners or for the respondents is not the compelling consideration. What is important and essential is that the  Court declare in a manner that cannot be misunderstood what the Constitution  commands and what the Constitution requires. It is true that the Court should not formulate a rule of  constitutional law broader than is required by precise facts to which it is  applied. It is true that a decision on a  question of a constitutional nature should only be as broad and detailed as is  necessary to decide it. There are, therefore, those who would limit a decision solely on the Transitory  Provisions of the 1973 Constitution. The  exercise of martial law powers under Article VII, Section 10, paragraph 2 of  the former Constitution or Article VII, Section 12 of the 1973 Constitution  have been subjected to intensive, searching and well-published challenges. 1 If We decide the case solely on the transitory  provision, uncertainty and confusion about martial law would remain. The provisions on martial law would still be  unexplained and unresolved by this Court. It is easy to see the patent undesirability of such a situation. In these petitions, our people await the decision of this Court  on the constitutional question. Considering, therefore, the importance which the instant petitions have  assumed, We must set forth the controlling and authoritative doctrines. VIII THE THREE PRINCIPAL ISSUES The Solicitor General stated the respondents' position as a narrow one — whether the arrest  and detention of the petitioners were legal. It is true that habeas corpus is intended for cases of  illegal confinement or detention by which a person is deprived of his liberty  (Section 1, Rule 102, Rules of Court). Its essential object is to inquire into all manner of involuntary  restraint and to relieve a person therefrom , if such  restraint is illegal ( Villavicencio vs . Lukban , 39 Phil. 778; Culauag vs . Director of Prisons, 17 SCRA 429) While the issue may be presented  in seemingly narrow terms, its scope and implications are not that simple. The respondents argue that this Court is  precluded by the Constitution  from inquiring into the legality of the detentions. They argue that such an inquiry is possible  only where the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is available  and inasmuch as the privilege of the writ has been suspended by the President  upon the proclamation of martial law, it follows that We should inhibit Ourselves  from asking for the reasons why the petitioners were arrested and  detained. It is argued t hat the Constitution has vested the determination of the necessity for and legality of detentions under martial law exclusively in the  Presidency a co - equal department of government. The principal issues, therefore, revolve around first the validity of Proclamation No. 1081. Second, assuming its original validity, may We inquire into the validity of its  continuation? And third, has the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus also been suspended upon the proclamation of  martial law? The extent of Our inquiry into the legality of the detentions and their efforts is  dependent on the answers to the foregoing issues. IX PROCLAMATION NO. 1081; A DEVIATION FROM THE TRADITIONAL  CONCEPT OF MARTIAL LAW; ARGUMENTS ON ITS VALIDITY In Proclamation No. 1081, dated September 21, 1972 , President Ferdinand E. Marcos placed  the entire Philippines as defined in Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution under martial law by  virtue of the power vested in the President of the Republic of the Philippines by Article VII, Section 10, par. (2) of the Constitution which reads “The President shall be the commander-in-chief of all armed forces  of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent  or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion. In case of invasion, insurrection, rebellion,  or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, he may suspend  the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law.” (a) What is martial  law? As the Solicitor General pointed out when asked to submit  definitions of martial law, there are as many definitions as there are court  rulings and writers on the subject. The  response of the petitioners gives the same impression. As good definitions as any that may have been made in the  past are the following: ""Generally speaking, martial law or more properly, martial  rule, is the temporary government and control by military force and authority  of territory in which, by reason of the existence of war or public commotion,  the civil government is inadequate to the preservation of order and the  enforcement of law. In strictness it is  not law at all, but rather a cessation  of all municipal law, as an incident of the jus belli , and because of paramount necessity,  and depends, for its existence, operation and extent, on the imminence of  public peril and the obligation to provide for the general safety. It is essentially a law or rule of force, a  purely military measure, and in the final analysis is merely the will of the  officer commanding the military forces. As the off­spring of necessity, it transcends and displaces the ordinary  laws of the land, and it applies alike to military and non-military persons,  and is exercisable alike over friends and enemies, citizens and aliens.""  (C.J.S. Vol. 93, pp. 115-­116, citing cases). ""Martial law is the exercise of the power which resides in the  executive branch of the government to preserve order and insure the public  safety in times of emergency, when other branches of the government are unable  to function, or their functioning would itself threaten the public  safety"". (Luther vs . Borden, 7 Hos .  ( US ) 1, 45, 12 L. ed. 581,  600): ""It is a law of necessity to be prescribed and  administered by the executive  power. Its object, the preservation of  the public safety and good order, defines its scope, which  will vary with the circumstances and necessities of  the case. The exercise of the power may not extend beyond what is required by the exigency which calls it forth.""  (Mitchell vs. Harmony, 13 How . (US) 115, 133, 14 L ed 75, 83; United    States vs . Russell, 13 Wall. (US)  623, 628, 20 Led 474, 475: Raymond vs .  Thomas, 91 US 712, 716, 23 L ed 434, 435; Sterling vs . Constantin , 190.) (Concurring opinion,  Duncan vs . Kahanamoku , 327 U.S. 334, 335, 90 L  ed 706 [1945-1946]). It has been held, therefore, that martial law is a ""law of actual military  necessity in actual presence of war, and  is administered by the general of the army whose will it is, subject to slight  limitations."" ( Constantin vs. Smith, D.C.  Text, 57 F. 2d 239). Under this same  ruling, martial law is strictly no law at all. It is a cessation of all municipal law. In another decision, it has been held that ""All respectable writers and publicists agree in the  definition of martial law that it is neither more nor less than the will of the  general who commands the army. It  overrides and suppresses all existing civil laws, civil officers and civil  authorities, by the arbitrary exercise of military power; and every citizen or  subject, in other words, the entire population of the country, within the  confines of its power, is subjected to the mere will or caprice of the  commander. He holds the lives, liberty  and property of all in the palm of his hands. Martial law is regulated by no known or established system or code of  laws, as it is over and above all of them. The commander is the legislator, judge and executioner."" (In  re: Egan, 8 Fed. Cas .  p. 367). Other definitions may be cited: ""Martial law . . . is not statutory in character and always  arises out of strict military necessity. Its proclamation or establishment is not expressly authorized by any of  the provisions of the Constitution; it comes into being only in the territory  of an enemy or in a part of the territory of the United States in time of war  or in time of peace in which the proper civil authority is, for some  controlling reason, unable to exercise its proper function."" (Charles  Warren, ""Spies, and the Power of Congress to Subject Certain Classes of  Civilian to Trial by Military Tribunal"", The American Law Review, LIll (March-April, 1919), 201-202). ""The term martial law refers to the exceptional measures  adopted whether by the military or the civil authorities, in times of war or of  domestic disturbance, for the preservation of order and the maintenance of the  public authority. To the operation of  martial law all the inhabitants of the country or of the disturbed district,  aliens as well as citizens, are subject."" ( Moore .  Int. Law Digest II, 186. As to the  subjection of aliens to Martial Law, See Moore, II, 196). ""Martial law relates to the domestic territory in a condition  of insurrection or invasion, when the Constitution and its civil authorities,  state or federal as the case may be, have been rendered inoperative or  powerless by the insurrectionary or invading forces. It is part of our domestic or municipal  law."" ( Arnold F., ""The  Rationale of Martial Law"", 15 ABAJ 551). A Philippine author has tried to reconcile the many definitions. ""Whatever the previous obscurity which has enveloped martial  law in both the British Empire and the United States, it is settled today that  martial law is (1) the exercise of military jurisdiction; (2) by the military  over the civilian population; (3) in a domestic territory; (4) on occasion of  serious public emergencies such as insurrection, rebellion invasion or imminent  danger thereof; (5) according to an unwritten law; and (6) as necessity  requires it."" (Santos, Martial Law, p. 81). The existing definitions are all based on the traditional  concepts. They were made at a time when  invasions were preceded by 48-hour ultimatums followed by a formal declaration  of war, and when insurrections, and rebellions involved frontal clashes between  opposing and well-defined forces. If one  group was overcome by the other, the losers would surrender their swords and  guns. The winners, in turn, might  magnanimously offer to return the swords and allow the losers to retain their  side arms, rifles, and horses for home use. In short, there were clear and sporting rules of the game which were  generally followed. (b) Modern Martial Law Martial law pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081, however, does not  completely follow the traditional forms and features which martial law has  assumed in the past. It is modern in  concept, in the light of relevant new conditions, particularly present day  rapid means of transportation, sophisticated means of communications,  unconventional weaponry, and such advanced concepts as subversion, fifth  columns, the unwitting use of innocent persons, and the weapons of ideological warfare. The contingencies which require a state of martial law are  time-honored. They are invasion,  insurrection and rebellion. Our  Constitution also allows a proclamation of martial law in the face of imminent  danger from any of these three contingencies. The Constitution vests the power to declare martial law in the President  under the 1935 Constitution or the Prime Minister under the 1973  Constitution. As to the form, extent,  and appearance of martial law, the Constitution and, our jurisprudence are silent. Martial law pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081 has, however,  deviated from the traditional picture of rigid military rule superimposed as a  result of actual and total or near total breakdown of government. Martial law was proclaimed before the normal administration of  law and order could break down. Courts of justice were still open and have  remained open throughout the state of martial law. The nationwide anarchy, overthrow of  government, and convulsive disorders which classical authors mention as essential  factors for the proclamation and continuation of martial law were not present. More important, martial law under Proclamation No. 1081 has not  resulted in the rule of the military. The will of the generals who command the  armed forces has definitely not replaced the laws of the land. It has not  superseded civilian authority. Instead  of the rule by military officials, we have the rule of the highest civilian and  elective official of the land, assisted by civilian heads of executive  departments, civilian elective local officials and other civilian  officials. Martial law under  Proclamation No. 1081 has made extensive use of military forces, not to take  over civilian authority but to insure that civilian authority is effective  throughout the country. This Court can  very well note that it has summoned and continues to summon military officers  to come before it, sometimes personally and at other times through  counsel. These military commanders have  been required to justify their acts according to our Constitution and the laws  of the land. These military officers are  aware that it is not their will much less their caprice but the sovereign will  of the people under a rule of law, which governs under martial law pursuant to  Proclamation No. 1081. It is this seemingly paradoxical nature of martial law in the Philippines that leads to the various questions raised in the instant petitions. It is also this apparently variant form and  its occasionally divergent scope  and effects which require this Court to explain just what the martial law provision of the  Constitution means. We must, perforce, examine the arguments of the parties on this  matter. (c) Respondents'  Arguments The respondents contend that when martial law was proclaimed on September  21, 1972, the rebellion and armed action undertaken by the lawless elements of  the communist and other armed aggrupations organized  to overthrow the Republic of the Philippines by armed violence and force had  assumed the magnitude of an actual state of war against our people and the  Republic of the Philippines. This  declaration is found in the last ""whereas"" of Proclamation No. 1081.  The following assertions of the factual situation on September 21, 1972 are also found in Proclamation  No. 1081. 1. There is a group of lawless elements who are moved by a common  or similar ideological conviction, design, strategy, and goal. Their prime purpose is to stage, undertake,  and wage an armed insurrection and rebellion against the government of the  Republic of the Philippines in order to forcibly seize political and state power in this country. They have in fact actually staged undertaken,  and waged this insurrection and rebellion. They want to overthrow the duly constituted government and supplant our  existing political, social, economic, and legal order with an entirely new  one. This new form of government, its  system of laws, its conception of God and religion, its notion of individual  rights and family relations, and its political, social economic, legal and  moral precepts are based on the Marxist, Leninist, and Maoist teachings and  beliefs. 2. These lawless elements have entered into a conspiracy and have  joined and banded their resources and forces. They use seemingly innocent and harmless although actually destructive  front organizations. These organizations  have been infiltrated or deliberately formed by them through sustained and  careful recruitment from among the peasantry, laborers, professionals, intellectual,  students, and mass media personnel. Their membership has been strengthened and broadened. This control and influence has spread over  almost every segment and level of our society  throughout the land. 3. The foregoing group of lawless elements enjoy the active, moral,  and material support of a foreign power to the months of May, June and July  1972, they brought into the country at Digoyo Point, Palanan , Isabela and other points  along the Pacific coast of Luzon, substantial quantities of war materials  consisting of around 3,500 M-14 rifles, several dozens of 40  mm rocket launchers, large quantities of 80 mm rockets and ammunitions and  other combat paraphernalia 4. The lawless elements have an  ov er-all revolutionary plan. They  have distributed their regional program of action for 1972 to their various  field commanders and party workers. The implementation of the program of action  from the intensification of recruitment to the assassination of high government  officials and the establishment of a provisional revolutionary government in  various towns and cities has actually commenced. Various incidents of bombings, strikes,  robberies, sabotage and demonstrations are actually in implementation of the  program of action. Liquidation missions  aimed at ranking government officials were about to be implemented by the  fielding of so-called Sparrow Units. 5. There is an equally serious disorder in Mindanao and Sulu resulting in actual war among Christians,  Muslims, Ilagas , Barracudas, the Mindanao  Independence Movement and government troops. Violent disorder in Mindanao and Sulu resulted in over 3,000 casualties and more than  500,000 injured, displaced and homeless persons. The economy of Mindanao and Sulu is paralyzed. 6. There is throughout the land a state of anarchy, lawless chaos,  disorder, turmoil and destruction of magnitude equivalent to an actual war  between government forces on the one hand and the New People's Army and  satellite organizations on the other. 7. The Supreme Court in the 1971 habeas corpus cases has  found that in truth and in fact there exists an actual insurrection and  rebellion in the country. Portions of  the Supreme Court decision are cited. It  was concluded by the Supreme Court that the unlawful activities of the  aforesaid elements pose a clear, present, and grave danger to public safety and  the security of the nation is also cited. (d) Petitioners'  Arguments On the other hand, the petitioners state that in the Philippines ""there has been no disruption at all; all government offices were  performing their usual functions; all courts were open and in the unobstructed  exercise of their jurisdiction at the time martial law was declared."" The  petitioners state that we have no Civil War in the Philippines and that no province, no city, no town throughout the Philippines has seceded from the Republic. They  state that there is no status of war and no status of belligerency. There is no armed struggle carried on between  two political bodies, each of which exercises de facto sovereignty over  persons within a determinate territory, and commands an army which is prepared  to observe the ordinary laws of war. On rebellion, the petitioners point out that the rebels have not  established an organized civil government nor occupied a substantial portion of  the national territory and, in fact, are described as mere ""lawless  elements."" The petitioners state that ""the thrust of martial law cases  is this — that for the requirement of public safety to be satisfied, civil  authority must have either fallen away or proved inadequate for the emergency,  the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal  justice according to law, and that where rebellion really exists, there is a  necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, and  as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern until the laws  can have their free course. For martial  rule can never exist where the courts are open and in the unobstructed exercise  of their jurisdiction."" The petitioners cite Arnold ,  in his article, “The Rationale of Martial Law"" (15 ABAJ 551). ""Martial law relates to the domestic territory in a condition  of insurre c tion or invasion, when  the Constitution and its civil authorities … HAVE BEEN RENDERED INOPERATIVE OR POWERLESS by the insurrectionary or  invading forces."" After citing the foregoing, petitioners asked this Court to take  judicial notice of the following: 1. Congress was in session  and was in the unobstructed exercise of its functions when martial law was  proclaimed; 2. The Supreme Court, the  Court of Appeals, the Courts of First Instance in the Greater Manila Area —  where petitioners had been arrested — indeed, even the municipal and city  courts were, at the time martial law was publicly announced, open and are still  open and functioning throughout the length and breadth of the land; no proof  has been shown that any court has been rendered ""unable to administer  justice,"" due to the activities of the rebels. Ironically, it is General Order No. 3, as  amended by General Order No. 3­-A, issued pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081,  that seeks to render them powerless, in many cases, to administer justice,  according to the Constitution and the laws of the land; 3. The Constitutional  Convention — the so-called ""fourth branch"" — had been holding its  sessions when martial law was proclaimed. Despite martial law, or probably  because of it, it decided to work with greater efficiency, it has just finished  its work. A ""plebiscite"" under  martial law is being called on January   15, 1973 , so the people can ""ratify"" the proposed  Constitution; 4. n the Greater Manila  Area, contrary to the speech of September 23, 1972 , no  university, college, or school was closed due to the activities of the rebels; 5. All instruments of mass  communications were in operation up to September   22, 1972 . The next day, free  speech and free press — the very heart of free inquiry and the search for truth  — became nothing but empty memories. Only the ""safe newspapers and radio- tv -stations"" were allowed to open. Political dissent was suppressed; 6. All agencies and  instrumentalities of government, national as well as local, were functioning  when martial law was proclaimed. By General Order No. 3. they were ordered ""to continue to function under their  present officers and employees and in accordance with existing laws .. ."" The petitioners state why Proclamation  No. 1081 is unconstitutional: These indisputable facts which require no introduction of proof —  because they all fall within the scope of judicial notice, under Rule 129 of  the Rules of Court — show that at the time martial law was declared there was  absolutely no justification for it, in fact and in law. Hence, Proclamation No. 1081 is  unconstitutional and void, because: 1. It is predicated on  the existence of ""the magnitude of an actual war"" or an ""actual  status of war"" that does not exist; 2. It is allegedly based  on the ""status of belligerency"" which no State in the world, not even  the Philippines ,  has extended to the rebels or the lawless elements described in the  Proclamation; 3. Although there may be  rebellion in some remote places, as in Isabela , there  is no justification for the declaration of martial law throughout the Philippines ,  since a) no large-scale,  nationwide rebellion or insurrection exists in the Philippines ; b) public safety does not  require it, inasmuch as no department of government, no government agency or  instrumentality, and even more important, no civil court of appellate or  original jurisdiction was, at the time martial law was proclaimed, unable to  open or function, or has been, at any time since the incumbent President came  into power ""rendered powerless or inoperative"" due to the activities  of the rebels or the lawless elements described in the Proclamation; c) The President himself  declared that the armed forces can handle the situation without ""utilizing  the extraordinary powers of the President"" (January 1, 1972), that long  before martial law was proclaimed, the Government had the ""rebellion  "" and the ""rebels and their supportores ""  under control, as the Army knew the step-by-step plot of the Communists and had  an hour-by-hour monitoring of the movements of the subversive leaders; d) The problem in the  Greater Manila Area where petitioners were seized and arrested — was, at the  time martial law was proclaimed, plain lawlessness and criminality. As the President described the situation in  his speech of September 23, 1972 : Lawlessness and criminality like kidnapping, smuggling, extortion,  blackmail, gun-running, hoarding and manipulation of prices, corruption in  government, tax evasion perpetrated by syndicated criminals, have increasingly  escalated. The petitioners pointed out that neither any of these or a  combination of all, constitute either the occasion or the justification for the  imposition of martial rule. Otherwise,  since these crimes have always been with us for many years, we would never see  the end of martial law in this country. It is argued that since Proclamation No. 1081 is unconstitutional  and void, the General Orders, issued in pursuance thereto and by way of its  implementation, must inevitably suffer from the same congenital infirmity. (e) Authorities cited  by the Parties — Petitioners and respondents, alike premise their arguments on the  martial law provision of the Constitution. Both cite decisions of foreign courts and treatises of foreign writers  expounding on martial law. And yet, completely divergent opinions on the  meaning of the provision is the result. Martial law is based on a law of necessity and is utilized as a  measure of governmental self-defense. It  is, therefore, an inherent power. It  needs no constitutional or statutory grant before it may be wielded. As the petitioners state (Addendum, pages  80-81), it is a recognized institution in the constitutional systems of both England  and America, notwithstanding lack of express provisions on martial law in  written constitutions. We accept judicial decisions of these countries as highly  persuasive, if not as precedents. The  absence of express recognition in the constitutions or statutes of these  countries helps explain why there is disagreement on a precise definition. More important, it explains why the  necessity, scope, and extent of martial law proclamations have to be determined  by the regular courts and why the decisions are, themselves, conflicting. The Constitutions and statutes are silent or  different from each other. The Courts  have been forced to go to the common law and to general principles of  Constitutional Law to look for bases of power and to resolve problems arising  out of states of martial law. The  various authorities cited by both petitioners and respondents in their  pleadings and oral arguments undoubtedly have valuable worth and applicability. They are very helpful in resolving the  momentous issues raised by the petitions. The fact remains, however, that they deal with an exercise of power  which is undefined. For the United  States Supreme Court, the power is not specifically prescribed in the federal  Constitution. This has led foreign  courts to naturally and logically look for the confining limits and  restrictions of ambiguous, cryptic, and perplexing boundaries. Since the power is not defined, the natural  tendency is not to describe it but to look for its limits. Anglo-American authorities may assist but  should not control because, here, the limits are present and determined by no  less than the fundamental law. In the Philippines ,  there is an ubiquitous and mandatory guide. The Constitution speaks in clear and positive terms. Given certain conditions, the Philippines or any part thereof may be placed under martial law. To resolve the instant  petitions, it is necessary to find out what the Constitution commands and what  the express words of its positive provision mean. It is the Constitution that should speak on  the circumstances and qualifications of the initiation and use of an awesome  emergency power. (b) More arguments of  the Respondents: According to the respondents, the Constitution plainly provides  that the circumstances when martial law maybe declared, its scope and its  effects are beyond judicial examination. The respondents contend that this Court lacks jurisdiction to take  cognizance of the instant petitions for habeas corpus . The Solicitor General has consistently  pleaded throughout these proceedings that the questions involved are political  and non- justiciable . He states that the President, sworn to defend the Constitution and the  Republic, proclaimed martial law pursuant to authority expressly conferred by  the Constitution. It is argued that his  decision is beyond controversion because the  Constitution has made it so and that only history and the Filipino people may  pass judgment on whether the President has correctly acted in a time of supreme  crisis. (a) More arguments of  the petitioner's: Petitioners, on the other hand, contend that this Tribunal is the  ultimate interpreter of the Constitution. As such, it has the power and duty to  declare Proclamation No. 1081 unconstitutional and void because the President  has exceeded his powers. It is argued  that where basic individual rights are involved, judicial inquiry is not  precluded. On the argument that martial  law is textually and exclusively committed to the President, the petitioners  answer that under the same Constitution, the President may not disable the  Court and oust them, particularly the Supreme Court of their jurisdiction to  hear cases assigned to Constitution and the laws. Petitioners stress that the Court should act  now or the time will come when it can no longer act, however, much it may wish  to for it shall have completely lost then the moral force and authority it  still possesses and the valid claim it may still have of being independent,  fearless, and just. X POLITICAL QUESTIONS AND COURT'S JURISDICTION OVER THEM The respondents' assertion that the questions raised in these  petitions are political and non- justiciable raises a  point which is easily misunderstood. What is a political question? In Mabanag vs . Lopez (78 Phil.  1, 4), this Court recognized the problems in trying to make a definition: ""It is a doctrine too well established to need citation of  authorities, that political questions are not within the province of the  judiciary, except to the extent that power to deal with such questions has been  conferred upon the courts by express constitutional or statutory provision. (16  C.J.S., 431). This doctrine is  predicated on the principle of the separation of powers, a principle also too  well known to require elucidation or citation of authorities. The difficulty lies in determining what  matters fall within the meaning of political question. The term is not susceptible of exact  definition, and precedents, and authorities are not always in full harmony as  to the scope of the restrictions, on this ground, on the courts to meddle with  the actions of the political departments of the government. I think it is time for this Court to distinguish between  jurisdiction over a case and jurisdiction over the issues raised in that  case. It is erroneous to state that when  a petition raises an issue which is political in nature, this Court is without  jurisdiction over the case. It has  jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to receive the petition and to  find out whether the issues are indeed political or not. A finding of political question is the  province of the Court in all cases. A  mere allegation of political questions does not automatically divest the Court  of its jurisdiction. The Court may, therefore,  require the parties to the case to prove or refute the existence of a political  question. The Court has jurisdiction to  receive the pleadings to listen to the arguments end to make up its mind. Once the Court, however, finds that the issue is political in  nature, it should rule that it has jurisdiction to decide the issue one way or  another still renders a decision. It  must still state that according to the Constitution, this matter is not for the  judiciary but for the political departments to decide. This is the task We must perform in these  petitions. When We decide whether or not  the issues are political in nature, We exercise jurisdiction. If We find a political question, We still  have jurisdiction over the case but not over the specific issue. A lot of emotionalism is directed against the Court when it rules  that a question is political. It is  alleged that the Court has surrendered its powers. The political question, it is said,  ""applies to all those questions of which the Court, at a given time, will  be of the opinion that it is impolitic or inexpedient to take jurisdiction. Sometimes this idea of inexpediency will  result from the fear of the vastness of the consequences that a decision on the  merits might entail. Sometimes, it will  result from the feeling that the Court is incompetent to deal with the type of  question involved. Sometimes, it will be  induced by the feeling that the matter is too high for the Courts""  (Finkelstein, ""Judicial Self Limitation"", 38 Harvard Law Review 328,  344). The political question doctrine is, therefore, described as a doctrine of  judicial opportunism. Like Pontius  Pilate, the Court is accused of tossing the hot issue for others to  determine. It is charged with washing  its hands off a difficult or explosive situation. A political question, it is alleged, is  nothing more than any question which the Court does not want to decide. It is understandable why courts should have a  seemingly natural or spontaneous tendency to reject a political question  argument. The charge that the Court is  abdicating a function or running away from responsibility can strike to the  very marrow of any judge's feelings. I do not share these misgivings. I positively reject them as wrong impressions. This Court is discharging a constitutional  duty when it determines that an issue is a political question. Because of its implications, however, this is  a fact which the Court must also explain in the simplest terms possible. The Constitution defines and limits the powers entrusted by the sovereign  people to their government. First, it declares the boundaries where the powers  of government cannot go further because individual rights would be  impaired. Second, it divides the powers  given to the entire government among the various departments and constitutional  bodies. Its provisions are, therefore,  both a grant and a limitation of power. In other words, the Constitution may be likened to a map. This map shows how the powers of sovereignty  have been distributed among the departments of government. It shows where there is a sharing of powers  or where checks and balances may be found. It also shows where there is a dividing line between government power  and individual liberty. In plainer  language, the constitutional map, like any other map, carries different  boundaries. The boundaries are the  delimitations of power. The function of the Court is to fix those boundaries whenever  encroachments are alleged. In doing so,  the Court interprets the constitutional map. It declares that this power is executive, that power is legislative, and  that other power is judicial. It may  sometimes state that a certain power, like impeachment, is judicial in  nature. Nonetheless, the constitutional  map has included impeachment within the boundaries of legislative  functions. The Court has to declare that  the judicial power of impeachment is exclusively for the legislature to  exercise. This task of allocating constitutional boundaries, I must repeat,  is given to this Court. It cannot be  divested of this jurisdiction. It cannot  yield this power. However, when the Court finds that a certain power is given by  the Constitution to a co-equal department, it must defer to the decision of  that department even if it appears to be seemingly judicial. It should declare  that the Constitution has vested this determination in the executive or the  legislature. The Court must, therefore,  state that it cannot go any further. The  sovereign people through the Constitution have drawn a boundary which this  Court has ascertained and which it must respect. When the Court finds a political question, it  is not, therefore, shirking or avoiding a duty. It is, in fact, complying  with its duty. Much as it wants to go  into the issues and decide the questions, it has to decline. The Constitution has given the power of  determination to another department. As  interpreter of the Constitution, the Court has to lead in respecting its boundaries. If we examine this Court's definition of a political question in Tañada vs. Cuenco (G.R. No. L-10520, February 28, 1957 ), We find  that it conforms to the foregoing explanation. In short, the term ""political question"" connotes, in  legal parlance, what it means in ordinary parlance, namely, a question of  policy. In other words, in the language  of Corpus Juris Secundum ( supra ),  it refers to ""those questions which, under the Constitution, are to be  decided by the people in their sovereign capacity, or in regard to which full  discretionary authority has been delegated to the legislature or executive  branch of the Government."" It is concerned with issues dependent upon the  wisdom not legality, of a particular measure. (Emphasis supplied) This is a determination of constitutional  boundaries. The Court has found that the Constitution has assigned a political  question to the people through a referendum or either one or both of the  political departments. A more complete definition is found in Baker vs. Carr (369 U.S. 186, 7L  Ed. 2d 663, 1962), to wit: ""It is apparent that several formulations which vary slightly according  to the settings in which the questions arise may describe a political question,  which identifies it as essentially  a function of the separation of powers. Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political  question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the  issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially  discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of  deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court's  undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due  coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning  adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of  embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one  question."" Again, the Court makes a determination that the Constitution has  vested the making of a final decision in a body other than the Court. XI PROCLAMATION NO. 1081 IS VALID — IT IS POLITICAL IN  NATURE AND THEREFORE NOT JUSTICIABLE How does the Court determine whether a martial law proclamation  is a political question or not? The respondents argue that only the President  is authorized to determine when martial law may be proclaimed. The petitioners insist that this Court may  examine and nullify the Presidential determination as beyond his constitutional  powers. Has the Constitution vested the power exclusively in the  President? Are the petitioners correct or is it the claim of respondents which  is valid? The rule in constitutional construction is to give effect to the  intent of the authors. The authors are,  first, the framers who are ordered by the sovereign people to represent them in  the specific assignment of drafting the fundamental law and second, the people,  themselves, who by their ratification confirm what their delegates have wrought  and manifested as expressions of the sovereign will. How, then, do we ascertain the intent of the authors on the grant  of martial law powers? A search for intent must necessarily start within the four  corners of the document itself. x x x The  question is one then of constitutional construction. It is well to recall fundamentals. The primary task is one of ascertaining and  thereafter assuring the realization of the purpose of the framers and of the  people in the adoption of the Constitution. We look to the language of the document itself in our search for  its meaning. We do not of course stop  there, but that is where we begin. x x x ( Tuazon & Co. vs . Land Tenure Administration, 31 SCRA 413, 422) The Constitution is sufficiently explicit in locating the power  to proclaim martial law. It is similarly  explicit in specifying the occasions for its exercise. ""In case of  invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the  public safety requires it, he (the President as Commander-in-Chief of all armed  forces of the Philippines )  may suspend the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law."" This provision on martial law is found in Article VII of the 1935  Constitution. This Article refers to the  Presidency. Section 10, where the  provision appears as the second paragraph, is exclusively devoted to powers  conferred by the Constitution on the President. This is in sharp contrast to  the Constitution of the United States where the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus appears, not as a grant of power under Article II on the Executive nor in the  first ten amendments constituting their Bill of Rights, but in Article I on the  Legislature. It is given not as a grant  of power but as a limitation on the powers of the Federal Congress. It is significant that, as regards the suspension of the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the Philippine Constitution treats it  both as a grant of power in the article on the Presidency and as a limitation  to government action in the article on the Bill of Rights. On the other hand,  there is no dual treatment of martial law. There is only a grant of power in Article VII to meet certain grave  dangers to the Republic. Nowhere in the  Constitution is it treated in terms of limitation. In J. M. Tuazon & Co., Inc. vs.  Land Tenure Administration, 31 SCRA 41,3,  423 , this Court ruled: ""Reference to the historical basis of this provision as  reflected in the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention, two of the  extrinsic aids to construction along with contemporaneous understanding and the  consideration of the consequences that flow from the Interpretation under  consideration, yields additional light on the matter."" Let us, therefore, look at the history of the provision. It is important to be guided by the authors  of the Constitution more than by citations from foreign court decisions and  quotations from constitutional law writers which petitioners and respondents  can seem to unendingly cull to sustain their diametrically opposed positions. The Philippine Bill of 1902 had no provision on martial law,  although it provided: ""SECTION 5. . . . That the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be  suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the  public safety may require it, in either of which events the same may be suspended  by the President, or by the Governor, with the approval of the Philippine  Commission, whenever during such period the necessity for such suspension shall  exist."" Both executive and legislative shared in deciding when the  privilege of the writ may be suspended. The Jones Law or Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916 required a  similar sharing of power as the Philippine Bill of 1902. Instead of approval of the Philippine  Commission, however, it provided that the President of the United States must  be notified whenever the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus has been  suspended or martial law has been proclaimed. ""SECTION 21 . . He shall be responsible for the faithful  execution of the laws of the Philippine Islands and of the United' States  operative within the Philippine Islands, and whenever it becomes necessary he  may call upon commanders of the military and naval forces of the United States  in the Islands, or summon the posse comitatus ,  or call out the Militia, or other locally created armed forces, to prevent or  suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion; and he may,  in case of rebellion or invasion  or imminent danger thereof, when  the public safety requires it, suspend the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus, or place the islands, or any part thereof, under martial law; Provided. That whenever the Governor-General shall exercise this authority, he shall at once notify the President of the United    States thereof together with the  attending facts, and circumstances, the President shall have power to modify or  vacate the action of the Governor-General."" (Italics supplied) The treatment of both martial law and habeas corpus as part of  the limitations in the Bill of Rights and as part of the grant of powers of the  Chief Executive started with the Jones Law. This organic act also added ""imminent danger"" as a ground for  suspension. This was the status of our Constitutional Law on habeas corpus  and on martial law when the 1935 Philippine  Constitution was drafted. The most  learned Philippine lawyers were among the delegates to the 1934 Constitutional Convention. The delegates had before them the Philippine  Bill of 1902 requiring approval  of the legislature before the Chief Executive may exercise his power. They had before them the provision of the  Jones Law qualifying the Governor-General's power with supervision and control  by the President of the United States who may modify or vacate the former's action. They chose to vest the power exclusively in  the President of the Philippines . They expanded the wide scope of his  authority by including ""imminent danger"" as an occasion for its  exercise, thus deliberately adopting the Jones Law provision minus the  limitation. Their proposal on martial  law was overwhelmingly ratified by the people. The choice was no perfunctory or casual  one. It was the product of thorough study and deliberation. While the debates in the 1935 Constitutional  Convention centered on habeas corpus, they necessarily apply to martial law  because the two are inextricably linked in one and the same provision. The Solicitor-General has summarized these  deliberations on habeas corpus and martial law. ""As a matter of fact, in the Constitutional Convention,  Delegate Araneta proposed the following provisions: ‘In case of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion, when the public  safety requires it, the National Assembly may suspend the privilege of the writ  of habeas corpus . Incase the  National Assembly is not in session, the President may suspend the privilege of  the writ of habeas corpus with the consent of the majority of the  Supreme Court, but this suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus will be revoked if the President does not call a special session of  the National Assembly within fifteen days from the decree suspending the writ  of habeas corpus or if the National Assembly fails to confirm the action  of the President within 30 days. (5 J. Laurel, Proceedings of the Philippine  Constitutional Convention; 259, (S.  Laurel ed. 1966) ""In support of' his proposal, Araneta argued, first , that the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of  habeas corpus should be vested in the National Assembly because that power was  ""essentially"" legislative. (Id. 249-­50) and second , that in  case the National Assembly was not in session, thus making it necessary to vest  the power in the President, that the exercise of the power be subject to the  concurrence of the Supreme Court and even when the Court has concurred in the  decision of the President that the suspension would be effective only for a  certain period unless the National Assembly was convened and its ratification  was secured. ( Id. , at 255). ""He was interpellated by various  delegates; Delegate Perez and Grageda , especially,  were concerned, lest the requirement of securing the concurrence of other  branches of government in the decision of the President deprives him of  effective means of meeting an emergency. ( Id. ,  at 255-56). The Committee on Sponsorship headed by  Delegate Sotto opposed the amendment. When finally put to vote, the amendment  was rejected. ( Id. , at 259). ""There are a number of points we should note regarding the  proposal. First, the proposal refers  only to the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus . It did not apparently contemplate the proclamation  of martial law. Second , the proposal would vest the power of suspension  in the National Assembly and in the President only when the National Assembly  is not in session. Third ,  exercise of the power by the President, is subject to the concurrence of the Supreme Court and the confirmation  of the National Assembly. ""The Constitutional Convention must have been aware of the  experience of President Lincoln during the American Civil War. They must have been aware of the views  expressed then that it was the legislature and not the President who may  suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or proclaim martial  law. Surely, they were cognizant of the  vast implications incident to a suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus and more so to the proclamation of martial law. This is reelected in the following records of  the proceedings: 'During the debates on the first draft, Delegate Francisco proposed  an amendment inserting, as a fourth cause for the suspension of the writ of  habeas corpus, imminent danger of the three causes included herein. When submitted to a vote for the first time,  the amendment was carried. After his Motion for a reconsideration of the amendment was  approved, Delegate Orense spoke against the amendment  alleging that it would be dangerous to make imminent danger a ground for the  suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. In part, he said: 'Gentlemen, this phrase is too ambiguous, and in the hands of a President who believes himself more or  less a dictator, it is extremely dangerous; it would be a sword with which he  would behead us."" ‘In defense of the amendment, Delegate Francisco pointed out that  it was intended to make this part of the bill of rights conform to that part of  the draft giving the President the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus  also in the case of an imminent danger of invasion or rebellion. When asked by Delegate Rafols if the phrase, imminent danger, might not be struck out from the corresponding  provision under the executive power instead, Delegate Francisco answered: 'Outright, it is possible to eliminate the phrase, imminent danger  thereof, in the page I have mentioned. But I say, going to the essence and referring exclusively to the  necessity of including the words, of imminent danger or one or the other, I  wish to say the following: that it  should not be necessary that there exist a rebellion, insurrection, or invasion  in order that habeas corpus may be suspended. It should be sufficient that there  exists not a danger but an imminent danger, and the word, imminent should be  maintained. When there exists an  imminent danger, the State requires for its protection, and for that of all the citizens the suspension of the  habeas corpus. 'When put to vote for the second time, the amendment was defeated  with 72 votes against and 56 votes in favor of the same. (I Aruego's Framing of the Philippine Constitution, 180-181)"" ""But the Convention voted for a strong executive, and wrote  Article VII, Section 10 (2) into  the Constitution. ""The conferment of the power in the President is clear and  definite. That the authority to suspend  the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and to proclaim martial law  was intended to be exclusively vested in the President, there can be no  doubt."" (Memorandum for Respondents dated November 17, 1972, pp. 11-14)"" The only conclusion I can make after ascertaining the intent of  the authors of the Constitution is that the power to proclaim martial law is  exclusively vested in the President. The  proclamation and its attendant circumstances therefore form a political  question. Unless this Court decides that every act of the executive and of  the legislature is justiciable there can be no  clearer example of a political question that Proclamation No. 1081. It is the exercise by the highest elective  official of the land of a supreme political  duty exclusively entrusted to him by the Constitution. Our people have entrusted to the President  through a specific provision of the fundamental law the awesome responsibility  to wield a powerful weapon. The people  have entrusted to him the estimation that the perils are so ominous and  threatening that this ultimate weapon of our duly constituted government must  be used. The Supreme Court was not given the jurisdiction to share the  determination of the occasions for its exercise. It is not given the authority  by the Constitution to expand or limit the scope of its use depending on the  allegations of litigants. It is not  authorized by the Constitution to say that martial law may be proclaimed in Isabela and Sulu but not in  Greater Manila. Much less does it have  the power nor should it even exercise the power, assuming its existence, to  nullify a proclamation of the President on a matter exclusively vested in him  by the Constitution and on issues so politically and emotionally charged. The Court's function in such cases is to  assume jurisdiction for the purpose of finding out whether the issues  constitute a political question or not. Its function is to determine whether or not a question is indeed justiciable . Petitioners want this Court to examine the bases given by the  President in issuing Proclamation No. 1081. They want the Court to find or to take judicial notice of the absence of  an insurrection or rebellion — of the absence of an imminent danger thereof.  Petitioners would have this Court dispute and nullify the findings of facts of  the President himself in a matter that is peculiarly executive in nature. Why should We honor the President's findings? In cases where the issues are indisputably judicial in nature,  the findings of the President are still given utmost respect and  deference. In the matter of the  declaration of martial law, a power that is exclusively vested in the  President, may the Court differ with the findings? No, because as We have  already stated, the valid reason for this exclusive grant of power is that  the President possesses all the facilities to gather the required data and  information and has a broader perspective to properly evaluate them, better  than any facility and perspective that the Court can have. At what state in an insurrection or how serious and manifest  should subversive activities become before the Court decides the particular  point when martial law may be proclaimed? The petitioners, relying on the  classic stages of governmental overthrow as experienced by pre-World War II  examples, would wait until all civil courts are closed and the country is in complete chaos. Petitioners do not realize that long before  the courts are closed, the President would have been killed or captured and the  enemy irrevocably entrenched in power. The authors of the Constitution never envisioned that the martial law  power so carefully and deliberately included among the powers of the President  would be withheld until such time as it may not be used at all. It is my firm view that the decision to proclaim martial law  is an exclusive function of the President. If he finds that invasion, insurrection, or rebellion or imminent danger  of any of the three is present, such finding is conclusive on the Court. If he finds that public safety requires the  entire country should be placed under martial law, that finding is conclusive  on the Court. In the exercise of such an  emergency power intended for the supreme and inherent right of self-defense and  self-preservation, the Constitution cannot be read to mean otherwise. In Lansang vs . Garcia (42 SCRA  448, 480) this Court stated that ""in the exercise of such authority (to  suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus), the function of the Court  is merely to check — not to supplant — the Executive , or  to ascertain merely whether he has gone beyond the constitutions limits of his  jurisdiction, not to exercise the power vested in him or to determine the  wisdom of his act."" I do not see how, both from the legal and practical points of  view, the Court can check the President's decision to proclaim martial  law. The same may, perhaps, be done as  regards a suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus although I  reserve a more definitive statement on that issue when a case squarely in point  on the matter is raised before Us. However, martial law poses entirely different problems. A proclamation of martial law goes beyond the  suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, whose effects are  largely remedied with the release of detainees. Upon proclaiming martial law, the President did not limit himself  to ordering the arrest and detention of the participants and others having a  hand in the conspiracy to seize political and state power. Under martial law, the President ordered the  takeover or control of communications media, public utilities, and privately  owned aircraft and watercraft. Foreign  travel was restricted. Curfew was  imposed all over the country. A purge of  undesirable government officials, through resignations or summary  investigations, was effected. The entire executive branch of government was  reorganized. A cleanliness and  beautification campaign, with martial law sanctions to enforce it, was  ordered. This was only the beginning. Consequences of Proclamation No. 1081 are many and  far-reaching. They permeate every aspect  and every activity in the life of the people. A court decision is not needed nor is it the proper place to enumerate  them. Most obvious, of course, are the  President's acts of legislation on the very broad range of subjects that  Congress used to cover. As early as November 8, 1972 , the petitioners  prepared a Memorandum stressing this point. It may be pointed out that since martial law was declared, the  President has been exercising legislative power that is lodged by the  Constitution in Congress. A good number  of the decrees promulgated have no direct relation to the quelling of the  disorders caused by the lawless elements. They are aimed at building a New  Society, but they cannot be justified as a valid exercise of martial, rule. (at  page 94) These implications and consequences of martial law serve to  bolster my view that the Constitution never intended that this Court could  examine and declare invalid the President's initial determination. The  Constitution did not intend that the Court could, in the detached and peaceful aftermatch of successful martial law, reach back and  invalidate everything done from the start. That would result in chaos. I am, of course, aware of the Chicot County Drainage District  vs. Baxter' State Bank ( 308 U.S. 371, 374) doctrine which this Court adopted in Municipality of Malabang vs. Pangandapun Benito ,  et al. (27 SCRA 533, 540): The Courts below have proceeded on the theory that the Act of  Congress having been found to be unconstitutional, was not a law; that it was  inoperative, conferring no rights and imposing no duties, and hence affording  no basis for the challenged decree. (Norton vs . Shelby County , 118 U.S. 425, 442: Chicago, I. & L. Ry . Co. vs . Hackett, 228 U.S. 559, 566). It is quite clear, however,  that such broad statements as to the effect of a determination of  unconstitutionality must be taken with qualifications. The actual existence of a statute, prior to  such a determination, is an operative fact and may have consequences which  cannot justly be ignored. The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial  declaration. The effect of the  subsequent ruling as to invalidity may have to be considered in various aspects  — with respect to particular relations, individual and corporate, and  particular conduct, private and official. Questions of rights claimed to have become vested of status, of prior  determinations deemed to have finality and acted upon accordingly, of public  policy in the light of the nature both of the statute and of its previous  application, demand examination. These  questions are among the most difficult of those which have engaged the  attention of courts, state and federal, and it is manifest from numerous  decisions that an all-inclusive statement of a principle of absolute  retroactive invalidity cannot be justified."" It may be argued that the actual existence of Proclamation No.  1081 is an operative fact and that its consequences should not be ignored. The operative fact doctrine, however, has no application in this  situation where, faced with insurrection and rebellion, the President proclaims  martial law. Even assuming that every  single member of this Court doubts the President's findings, We have to  consider that the Constitution vests the determination in him. The stakes involved are supreme and the  determination must be made immediately and decisively. There is the possibility that the President has an exaggerated  appreciation of the dangers and has overreacted with the use of the awesome  measure of martial law. The fact remains, however, that the authors of the  Constitution were aware of this possibility and still provided that the power  exclusively belongs to him. It would be  stretching the plain words of the Constitution if we weigh our personal  findings against the official findings  of the President. He possesses all the  facilities to gather data and information and has a much broader perspective to properly evaluate them. He is performing a  func tion which is, of  course, required by the Constitution  to be discharged by the President. And for us to venture  into a judicial inquiry on the factual basis of the constitutionality of the martial law proclamation  would be to ignore the  well-established principle of presidential privilege which exempts the President from divulging even to the highest court of  the land facts which if  divulged would endanger national security. As a matter of fact, in the latest case on this matter which  was that filed against President Richard M. Nixon, although the Supreme Court  of the United States ordered the President to produce the tapes of his  conversation with some of his aides pursuant to a subpoena for use in a  criminal prosecution against one of his aides, because the claim that  ""disclosures of confidential conversation between the President and his  close advisors … would be inconsistent with the public interest ... cannot  outweigh ... the legitimate needs of the judicial process"" in a criminal  prosecution, the Court, however, made the statement from which we can infer  that if President Nixon had only claimed that the tapes contain ""military,  diplomatic or sensitive national security secrets"", it would have sustained  the refusal of Nixon to produce them. ""... However, when the privilege depends solely on the broad,  undifferentiated claim of public interest in the confidentiality of such  conversations, a confrontation with other values arises. Absent a claim of need to protect  military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets, we find it  difficult to accept the argument that even the very important interest in  confidentiality of presidential communications is significantly diminished by  production of such material for in camera inspection with all the protection  that a district court will be obliged to provide."" ""In this case the President challenges a subpoena served on  him as a third party requiring the production of materials for use in a  criminal prosecution on the claim that he has a privilege against disclosure of  confidential communications. He does not place his claim of privilege on the  ground they are military or diplomatic secrets. As to these areas of Art. II duties the courts have traditionally shown  the utmost deference to presidential responsibilities. In C. & S. Air Lines vs . Waterman Steamship Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 111 (1948), dealing with  presidential authority involving foreign policy considerations, the Court said: ""The President, both as Commander-in-chief and as the Nation's  organ for foreign affairs, has available intelligence services whose reports  are not and ought not to he published to the world. It would be intolerable that courts, without  relevant information, should review and perhaps nullify actions of the  Executive taken on information properly held secret."" Id. at 111 In the United    States vs . Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1 (1952), dealing with a  claimant's demand for evidence in a damage case, against the Government, the Court said: ‘It may be possible to satisfy the court, from all the  circumstances of the case, that there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of  the evidence will expose military  matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be  divulged. When this is the case, the  occasion for the privilege is appropriate, and the court should not jeopardize  the security which the privilege is meant to protect by insisting upon an  examination of the evidence, even by the judge alone, in chambers.' No case  of the Court, however, has extended this high degree of deference to a  President's generalized interest in confidentiality. Nowhere in the Constitution, as we have noted  earlier, is there any explicit reference to a privilege of confidentiality, yet to the extent this interest  relates to the effective discharge of a President's powers, it is  constitutionally based."" (United States, Petitioner, vs .  Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States, et al., Richard M. Nixon,  President of the United States, Petitioner, vs . United States; July 24,  1974; Nos. 73-17666 and 73-1834; Supreme Court of the United States) It is for the above reasons that, as far as the proclamation is  concerned, the Court should revert to the rule in Barcelon vs. Baker (6 Phil. 87) and Montenegro vs. Castaneda (91 Phil.  886). The only questions which the  judiciary should look into are (1) Did the Constitution confer the authority to  suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and proclaim martial law on  the President? and (2) Did the President declare that he is acting under such  authority and in conformance with it? The authority being exclusively vested in  the President, his decision is final and conclusive upon the Court. Insofar as the President's decision to proclaim martial law is  concerned, it is, therefore, my  view that under the Constitution, the Supreme Court has no authority to inquire  into the existence of a factual basis for its proclamation. The constitutional sufficiency for the  proclamation is properly for the President alone to determine. XII GRANTING THAT PROCLAMATION NO. 1081 IS NOT POLITICAL  BUT JUSTICIABLE, IT IS STILL VALID BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT ACTED  ARBITRARILY IN ISSUING IT It should be noted that Proclamation No. 1081 is not a mere conclusion  that there is insurrection and rebellion in the country. The President did not limit himself to a curt  and laconic declaration that on the basis of his findings, there is  insurrection or a rebellion and that he has proclaimed martial law. Proclamation No. 1081 specifies in twenty-six (26) printed pages  the various findings which led to its promulgation. The conspiracy to overthrow the government,  the rapidly expanding ranks of the  conspirators, the raising of funds and materials under centralized direction,  the maintenance of a rebel army, the massive propaganda campaign, the acts of  sabotage and armed insurrection or rebellion, the previous decision of this  Court, the lawlessness and disorder in the country, the violent demonstrations  led by Communist fronts, the armed clashes between rebels and government  troops, the active moral and material support of a foreign power, the  importation of firearms and war material by rebels, the presence of a  well-scheduled program of revolutionary action, the organization of liquidation  squads, the serious disorder in Mindanao and Sulu ,  the activities of the Mindanao Independence Movement, the thousands killed and  hundreds of thousands of injured or displaced persons, the inadequacy of simply  calling out the armed forces or suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus, the alarmingly rapid escalation of rebel or subversive activities, and  other evidence of insurrection or rebellion are specified in detailed manner. The findings of the President are given in a positive, detailed,  and categorical form. As a matter of  fact, subsequent events, related to the Court in a series of classified  briefings made to it by the Army, the last one being on August 15, 1974,  confirm the over-all validity of the President's basis. There is constitutional sufficiency for his  conclusion that martial law be proclaimed. Proclamation No. 1081 does not, therefore, suffer any constitutional  infirmity of arbitrariness, granting that this test can be applied to it. It appears proper, at this point, to elucidate further on the  test of arbitrariness. The Court's decision in Lansang vs. Garcia (42 SCRA 448) has been interpreted  and, to my mind, misunderstood by many people to mean that the Court had  completely reversed Barcelon vs. Baker and Montenegro vs. Castaneda . There are, of course, certain statements in  the decision that give rise to this conclusion. For instance, the Court stated that the weight of Barcelon vs. Baker , as precedent, is diluted by two factors, namely, (a) it relied  heavily upon Martin vs. Mott (6 L. ed. 537) involving the U.S. President's power to call out the militia and  (b) the fact that suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas, corpus was  by the American Governor-General, the representative of the foreign  sovereign. The Court stated that in the Barcelon case it went into the question — Did  the Governor?General act in conformance with the authority vested in him  by the Congress of the United States ?  In other words, the Court stated that it made an actual determination whether  or not the Chief Executive had acted in accordance with law. The Court also added that in the Montenegro case, it considered the question whether or not there really was a  rebellion. The Court reviewed American  jurisprudence on suspension of the privilege. It stated that the tenor of the  opinions, considered as a whole, strongly suggests the Court's conviction that  the conditions essential for the validity of proclamations or orders were in  fact present. It stated that whenever  the American courts took the opposite view, it had a backdrop permeated or  characterized by the belief that said conditions were absent. In truth, however, the decision in Lansang vs. Garcia does not state that the Court may conduct a full examination  into the facts which led the President to issue the proclamat ion. The Court's decision categorically  asserts that the examination presidential acts by the Court is limited to  arbitrariness. The Court accepted the  view — ... that judicial inquiry into the basis of the questioned  proclamation can go no further than to satisfy the Court not that the  President's decision is correct and that public safety was endangered by the  rebellion and justified the suspension of the writ, but that in suspending the  writ, the President did not act arbitrarily. The Court adopted as the test of validity, the doctrine in Nebbia vs. New York . 291 U.S. 502 — . . . If the laws  passed are seen to have a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose,  and are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, the requirements of due process  are satisfied, and judicial determination to that effect renders a court functus oficio ... With the  wisdom of the policy adopted, with the adequacy or practicality of the law  enacted to forward it, the courts are both incompetent and unauthorized to deal  ... For purposes of comparison and emphasis, the Court, in Lansang vs. Garcia . went into the judicial  authority to review decisions of administrative bodies or agencies. It stated that the reviewing court determines  only whether there is some evidentiary basis for the contested administrative  findings and does not undertake quantitative examination of supporting  evidence. Therefore, the Court stated  that it interferes with an administrative finding only if there is no evidence  whatsoever in support thereof and said finding is actually arbitrary,  capricious, and obviously unauthorized. The Court ruled that this approach of deferring to the findings of administrative bodies cannot even be  applied in its aforesaid form to test the validity of an act of Congress or of  the Executive. The presumption of  validity is of a much higher category. The Court emphasized that the  co-equality of coordinat e branches  of the government under our constitutional system demands that the test of  validity of acts of Congress and of those of the Executive should be  fundamentally the same. And this test  is not correctness but arbitrariness . It follows, therefore, that even if I were to subscribe to the  view that Lansang vs. Garcia should not be categorically reversed as erroneous doctrine, my decision would be the same. Even under Lansang vs. Gorica martial law is valid. There is nothing arbitrary in the decision to promulgate  Proclamation No. 1081. It is not  unconstitutional. XIII THE CONTINUATION (AND EVENTUAL LIFTING) OF THE STATE OF MARTIAL LAW IS A POLITICAL  QUESTION The continuation of the state of martial law and t he resulting continued restrictions on  individual liberties are, of course, serious aspects of the main issue with which this Court is concerned. In fact, this is the more difficult question — The President  having acted upon an initial and positive finding that martial law is  necessary, may the Court inquire into the bases for its duration or the need  for its continued imposition? Towards the end of this separate opinion, I answer the arguments  of the petitioners questioning the effectivity and  legality of the new Constitution. It is  my unqualified vi e w, as explained  later, that this Court in the Ratification Cases declared the new Constitution  to be legally in force and effect. I have to mention this view, at this juncture, because martial  law was proclaimed under the old Constitution. However, its continuation and eventual lifting are now governed by the  new Constitution. The exercise of martial law power may be likened to the  jurisdiction of a court. A court may  have jurisdiction under an old law but the jurisdiction may be removed or  modified by a new statute. In other  words, is the continuing state of martial law valid under the new Constitution?  Is it also a political question under the present Charter? Article IX of the new Constitution on the Prime Minister and the  Cabinet provides: ""SEC. 12. The Prime Minister shall be commander-in-chief of  all armed forces of the Philippines and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may  call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion,  insurrection, or rebellion in case of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, or  imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, he may suspend the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or place the Philippines or any part  thereof under martial law."" It should be noted that the above provision is a verbatim  reiteration of Article VII, Section 10, Paragraph (2) of the old Constitution. What was the intent of the framers in adopting verbatim the  provision found in the old Constitution? At this point, modesty and prudence should inhibit me from advancing  my own views as the only member of this Tribunal who was a delegate to the 1971 Constitutional Convention. In Vera vs. Avelino (77 Phil. 192), this Court stated — ""The theory has been proposed — modest y aside — that the dissenting members of this Court who were  delegates to the Constitutional Convention and were ""co-authors of the  Constitution"" ""are in a better position to interpret"" that same  Constitution in this particular litigation. ""There is no doubt that their properly recorded utterances during  the debates and proceedings of the Convention deserve weight, like those of any  other delegate therein. Note, however,  that the proceedings of the Convention ""are less conclusive of the proper  construction of the instrument than are legislative proceedings of the proper  construction of a statue; since in the latter case it is the intent of the  legislature we seek, while in the former we are endeavoring to arrive at the  intent of the people through the discussions and deliberations of their  representatives."" ( Willoughby on the Constitution, Vol. I, pp. 54, 55.) ""Their writings (of the delegates) commenting or explaining  that instrument, published shortly thereafter, may, like those of Hamilton,  Madison and Jay in The Federalist — here in the Philippines, the book of  Delegate Aruego , supra, and of others — have  persuasive force. (Op. cit., p. 55.) ""But their personal opinion on the matter at issue expressed  during our deliberations stand on a different footing: If based on a ""fact"" known to them,  but not duly established or judicially cognizable, it is immaterial, and their  brethren are not expected to take their word for it, to the prejudice of the  party adversely affected, who had no chance of rebuttal. If on a matter of legal hermeneutics, their  conclusions may not, simply on account of membership in the Convention, be a  shade better, in the eyes of the law. There is the word ""deference"" to be sure. But deference is a compliment spontaneously  to be paid — never a tribute to be demanded. ""And if we should (without intending any disparagement)  compare the Constitution's enactment to a drama on the stage or in actual life,  we would realize that the intelligent spectators or readers often know as much,  if not more, about the real meaning, effects or tendencies of the event, or  incidents thereof, as some of the actors themselves, who sometimes become so  absorbed in fulfilling their emotional roles that they fail to watch the other  scenes or to meditate on the larger aspects of the whole performance, or what  is worse, become so infatuated with their lines as to construe the entire story  according to their prejudices or frustrations. Perspective and disinterestedness help certainly a lot in examining  actions and occurrences. ""Come to think of it, under the theory thus proposed, Marshall  and Holmes (names venerated by those who have devoted a sizeable portion of  their professional lives to analyzing or solving constitutional problems and  developments) were not so authoritative after all in expounding the United  States Constitution — because they were not members of the Federal Convention  that framed it! (pp. 215-216)"" I wish to follow the example, however, of my distinguished  colleague, Mr. Justice Calixto O. Zaldivar in Philippine Constitution Association vs. Mathay (18 SCRA 300) where, with characteristic humility, he stated in a concurring  opinion - ""My opinion in this regard is based upon a personal knowledge  of how the constitutional proviso, Article VI, Section 14 of the Constitution,  which is now in question, became a part of our present Constitution. It was the Second National Assembly which  amended our original Constitution. I was  a humble Member of the Second National Assembly, representing the province of Antique . * * * * * * * * * ""I still have vivid recollections of the important points  brought up during the deliberations in caucus over proposed amendments and of  the agreements arrived at. I remember  too the influences that worked, and the pressures that were brought to bear  upon the Assemblymen, in the efforts to bring about agreements on very  controversial matters and thus secure the insertion of the desired amendments  to the Constitution. The discussions on  the proposed amendments affecting the legislative branch of the government were  specially of interest to us then because we were in some way personally  affected, as most of us were interested in running for re-election. ""It is not my purpose here to impose on anyone my  recollections of matters that were brought up during our caucuses then, but I  only wish to emphasize the fact that my concurring opinion in the decision of  the case now before Us has for its basis my honest and best recollections of  what had transpired, or what had been expressed, during the caucuses held by  the Members of the Second National Assembly in the deliberations which later  brought about the 1940 amendments. * * * * * * * * * ""I have endeavored to make a discourse of facts as I know  them, because I sincerely believe that the interpretation, embodied in the opinion  penned by my esteemed colleague, Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes, of the pertinent  provision of Article VI, Section 14 of our Constitution is in consonance with  the facts and circumstances as I remember them, and as I know them. As I have stated at the early part of this  concurring opinion, it is not my purpose to impose on anyone my recollection of  what transpired, or of what had been discussed about, or of what had been  agreed upon, by the Members of the Second National Assembly during the  deliberations which brought about the 1940 amendments to our Constitution. My perception and my memory areas frail as  those of any other human being, and I may have incurred myself in error. It just happened that the facts and the  circumstances that I have herein narrated, as I remember them, have engendered  in my mind an opinion, nay a conviction, which dovetails with the opinion of my  illustrious colleague that has penned the opinion for the majority of the Court  in this case."" (at pp. 316, 317 and 327-328) Justice Zaldivar's recollections on the  intent of the Second National Assembly meeting as a constituent body in 1940 are most helpful. There are no  existing records of the deliberations on the Article VI Section 14 amendment to  the 1935 Constitution. The amendment  discussions and debates which took place during legislative caucuses are  unrecorded and this Court has Justice Zaldivar to  thank for his recollections. It is in this spirit that  I venture my own recollections. I am  also fairly certain that when the proceedings of the 1971 Constitutional  Convention are published, my observations will be sustained. When the last Constitutional Convention  approved the New Constitution on November   29, 1972 , the delegates were aware of pre-convention proposals to  subject exercise of the power by the Executive to judicial inquiry. Studies on the wisdom of having a joint  exercise of the power by the Executive and the Legislature were before the  delegates. (U.P. Law Center Constitution Revision Project, 1970. pp. 104-108)  There were even constitutional law scholars who questioned the power altogether  and wanted it removed. They claimed that  whether or not martial law is in the Constitution, it will be declared when  absolutely necessary and, therefore, anticipating its use through a  constitutional provision serves no useful purpose. The delegates were fully aware of the Government stand on the  habeas corpus and martial law provision. The Lansang vs. Garcia decision was fairly recent. The powers of the Chief Executive were extensively debated. The delegates knew that in the Lansang vs. Garcia proceedings, the Solicitor  General had consistently and forcefully argued that Barcelon vs. Baker and Montenegro vs. Castañeda were correct interpretations of the President's power to suspend the privilege  of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law. More significant is the fact that when the new Constitution was  finalized and the draft corrected and approved prior to submission to the  people, we were already under a state of martial law. The petitioners had been arrested and various  petitions filed. In fact, petitioner E.  Voltaire Garcia II included in his petition the argument that his detention  pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081 deprived his constituency of their  representation in the Constitutional Convention. The delegates were aware that  Proclamation No. 1081 was challenged before this Court and that the Solicitor  General's answer to all the petitions was invariably the doctrine of political  question. If it was the intent of the Constitutional Convention to subject  the Prime Minister's exercise of the power to judicial inquiry and/or control,  the provision on martial law would have been accordingly amended. In fact, during deliberations of the  Committees on Civil and Political Rights and Executive Power, there were  proposals that the power to proclaim martial law be subjected to control,  confirmation, or reversal by Congress or the Supreme Court, but the Convention  did not accept any of these proposals and decided to simply reiterate the  earlier provision. It would be enlightening for us to peruse the pertinent portions  of the proceedings of the Committee on Civil and Political Rights and Executive  Power, and I quote: Republic of the Philippines 1971 CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION Manila COMMITTEES ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS AND EXECUTIVE  POWER MINUTES OF THE MEETING (Joint Public Hearing) WEDNESDAY,   SEPTEMBER 8, 1971 Session Hall, Manila Hotel COMMITTEE ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS PRESENT Chairman Delegate De la Serna Vice  Chairman: Delegate Abueg Members: 1.

Delegate Castillo Guest : Justice Enrique Fernando Minutes . . . September 8, 1971 Committees on Civil and  Political Rights and Executive Power OPENING  OF THE MEETING 1. At 9:50 a.m. , Chairman Victor De la Serna called the meeting  to order. 2. Upon certification of the  Secretary, the Chair announced the existence of a quorum. 3. The Chair then announced  that the Committee has furnished the body resolutions regarding the suspension  of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. The Chair mentioned six  Resolutions Numbered 176, 260, 531, 1415, 239 and 2394. 4. The Chair further said  that the resolutions can be grouped into three schools of thought — the first,  refers to the absolute prohibition against suspension of the privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus by any authority in any and all events; the second  supports the theory that it may be suspended by the President with the  concurrence of Congress or the Supreme Court; and the third, refers to the  removal of the power to suspend from the President and transfer the same to the  Supreme Court. 5. The Chair then introduced to the  members the guest speaker, Justice Enrique Fernando of the Supreme Court of the Philippines . He expressed few words of welcome to the  Justice in behalf of the two Committees conducting the public hearing. 6. Justice Fernando started  his remarks by clarifying that he would only answer questions that will not  conflict with his role as Justice of the Supreme Court, since there was a  pending case before the said Court where the Power of the President to suspend  the writ of habeas corpus is placed at issue. He said that he considered the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus as  the most important human right. He is of  the view that it might be preferable if the Bill of Rights make it clear and  explicit that at no time and under no circumstances should the privilege of the  writ be suspended. He clarified that  even if this power to suspend the privilege of the writ were removed from the  President, he still has enough powers to prevent rebellion, sedition,  insurrection or imminent danger thereof because of his power to call the armed  forces in case the need for it arises. 7. The Chair asked the first  question to Justice Fernando. Because  the Justice said that it was not necessary to grant the President the power to  suspend the writ since Congress can always pass a law that would lengthen the  period of detention of prisoners, the Chair asked if it would not be very  cumbersome for Congress to enact such a law in times of national emergency. 8. Justice Fernando, in  answer to the Chair's query, said that Congress can pass a law to that effect  without a national emergency. 9. In answer to question  propounded by Delegate Ceniza , Justice Fernando said  in 1951 in the Hernandez case he expressed the opinion that even if the  privilege of the writ were suspended, the right to bail could still be availed  of. He admitted, however, that up to now  there is no clear-cut ruling on the matter. He also said that the President, should have the sole power to declare  Martial Law. 10. Delegate Mendiola also asked Justice Fernando who would determine  the circumstances that would warrant the detention of prisoners for a longer  period than what is now provided under the Revised Penal Code. The Justice answered that if the prisoner is  held for crimes against public order, then the ordinary rules of criminal law  will govern. The arresting authorities, in collaboration with the Fiscal, will  determine said circumstances. 11. Delegate Laggui asked Justice  Fernando whether he would still deny the power to suspend the writ to the  President if the Convention writes into the Constitution safeguards against  abuse of said power. The Justice said he would still say that the power be  denied the President because he considers the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus as the most important human right. 12. Delegate Gunigundo interpellated the Justice and asked whether the latter  would favor preventive detention of political prisoners or political offenders.  The Justice said we should follow the Constitutional Provisions regarding  probable cause, and the rights of the accused should always be respected. 13. Delegate Santillan asked Justice Fernando whether he would favor the  proposal to delete the phrase ""imminent danger thereof"" and to limit  the suspension of the writ from 10 to 15 days unless Congress or the  Supreme Court would extend the same. Justice Fernando said, since he was for the denial of the power to  suspend the writ, anything less than that would not be in consonance with his  stand. 14. Delegate Zafra asked Justice Fernando  if it would not be dangerous for a President to declare Martial Law because if  he did, the military might take over the government and topple down the  President and even Congress, thereby establishing military dictatorship. Justice Fernando said that the danger exists. 15. Delegate Exmundo interpellated Justice Fernando and asked the latter what the President of the Philippines should have done instead of suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus, considering the chaos and turmoil that prevailed prior to the suspension. The Justice said that since it is the duty of  the President to faithfully execute the laws, he should and he could have  called out the armed forces to suppress insurrection, invasion, and rebellion. 16. Others like Delegates Mastura , Adil , Guzman, Pepito , Veloso , Bengzon , Leviste (O.). and Ceniza interpellated Justice Fernando. The Chair then thanked the Justice for his  enlightening speech, He expressed the hope that at some future time, the  Justice would again favor the Committee with, his appearance so that the  members could propound more questions.

At 9:30 a.m. Chairman Victor De la Serna called the meeting to order and declared the  existence of a working quorum. 2. Chariman Gerardo S. Espina stated that it was a joint hearing of the  Committee on Civil and Political Rights and the Committee on Executive Powers. 3. The Chair confirmed the statement of Chairman Espina and further slated that it was the second  joint hearing of the two  Committees and introduced Senator Jose W. Diokno ,  guest speaker for the hearing. 4. Senator. Diokno thanked the joint body for giving him an opportunit y to discuss with them the power to suspend the privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus and the power to declare martial law. To be able to resolve the problem, he  propounded the questions: (1) should the  President have the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus,  (2) assuming he was given the power, under what circumstances should he be  allowed to exercise it, and (3) what safeguards should be placed upon the  exercise of that power. He surmised that  in his opinion, if the only legal basis for the grant of the power is to bide  time to be able to bring persons to court for it to decide on the matter, as  such time is always available to the government, he saw no reason in suspending  the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, since the same objective can be  attained by the imposition of martial law, which is not a graver step and is  not gravely abused in the practical point of view that no President will  declare martial law unless he can have the armed forces agree with him that  there is actual invasion, rebellion or insurrection. He stated that the  present Constitution only allowed the suspension of the privilege in cases of  extreme emergency affecting the very sovereignty of the State, which in his  belief, is only in cases of invasion, rebellion or insurrection. He did not agree that there should be a  safeguard provided, prior to the issuance of the proclamation suspending the  privilege of the writ but rather after the writ has been suspended, by  requiring either the courts or Congress to pass upon the necessity of the  suspension of the writ. He dissented with  the idea that there should be a definite time period for its validity, because  it is difficult to determine what should be an adequate period, however, the  Supreme Court or Congress could always be required to act within a definite period on the  validity of the suspension which he considered, already a proper safeguard. He added further that the power to place  any part of the national territory under martial law should be limited to cases  only of actual invasion, rebellion or insurrection. However, he strongly favored the deletion 'of  the provision ""on imminent danger"", which he stressed, is an excuse  for a dictatorial President to declare martial law on the ground that there is  imminent danger when there is none. There is a possibility, he said, that the armed forces will be broken  up, in the sense that one group may favor the President and the other may  refuse to allow themselves to be used when there is actually no ""imminent  danger"", so that instead of their helping preserve peace and order it  ""would provide an occasion for bringing about revolutions: 5. The Chair asked the Senator if the President  should declare martial law in places where imminent danger actually exists and  the civil authorities are still functioning. He further qualified in the phrase  ""martial law"" that the civil authorities call upon the military  authorities to help them or is it a complete and arbitrary substitution of  authority by the military. 5.1. Senator Diokno replied that the President's action in his personal opinion, is arbitrary and  illegal, but who could stop him from doing that. Even the Supreme Court is reluctant to act  because it has the army to reckon with. He construed that martial law could be legally exercised only in places where  actual fighting exists and the civil authorities are no longer exercising  authority, in which case the military can supplant the civil authorities. He added that it is also possible to declare  a limited martial law in certain areas where the military may impose curfew and  temporary detention of persons charged of causing and participating in chaotic  situations. 6. Chairman Espina recognized Delegate Britanico who had the first option to interpellate the Senator. 6.1 Delegate Britanico wanted to know from the Senator whether, in his opinion, the power to suspend  the writ be altogether removed from the President, and that in the event this  power is retained, how should it be exercised by the President? 6.2 Senator Diokno replied that if this power is retained it should be exercised by the President  alone but subject to review by either Congress or the Parliamentary Body that  may eventually be adopted. 6.3 Delegate Britanico wanted the view of  the Senator if he was agreeable to have the President share the power with the  Vice President, Senate majority and minority floor leaders, Senate President,  Justices of the Supreme Court, the Comelec Chairman  and other heads of constitutional organizations. 6.4 Senator Diokno replied that, he is averse to sharing powers because it could not be done  expediently. The Senator reminded the group  that as a general rule, the President and the President of the Senate belong to  the same party and even the justices of the Supreme Court fall under the same  situation, and it would then still be the President who will decide. 7. The Chair called on Delegate Olmedo on his reservation to ask the next question. 7.1 Delegate Olmedo wanted to clarify if there is any technical distinction between suspension of  the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and the writ itself. 7.2 Senator Diokno replied that the writ itself is the order of the court to the person having  custody of the subject to produce him in court, and that the subject has the  privilege to post bail pending the filing of the case against him if he is to  be heard for an offense. He cited the  decision of the Confederate Authority which says that the privilege of the writ  refers to criminal arrests in which the persons arrested have the privilege to  be released on bail, which is the privilege that is suspended. 7.3 Delegate Olmedo asked whether the Senator's stand on the abolition of the power to suspend the  privilege of the writ or as an alternative, the suspension be exercised with  the participation of other agencies, is because of the anti-administration  group clamoring for its abolition from the constitutional provisions? 7.4 Senator Diokno reiterated his statement that it is his personal belief that martial law is a  better measure than the suspension of the privilege of the writ, which the  President claims to have exercised to dismantle the communist apparatus in the  country. Whether this is justified or not remains an issue. Assuming that the Communists are arrested  now, new leaders will come up and take over command, and these new ones are not  yet known to the military authorities and so the same communistic situation  continues to exist and the cycle goes on unresolved. 7.5 As a last question, Delegate Olmedo sought to be clarified on the alternative view of  the Senator — that of retaining the power but its exercise be with the concurrence  of Congress and the Supreme Court. 7.6 The Senator reiterated that he is for the  abolition of the power, but if the Constitutional Convention believes it  necessary to retain it, then its exercise by the executive must be subject to  review and reversal, if need be, by Congress and the Supreme Court. He maintained that the exercise of the power  to suspend the privilege of the writ is determined by two factors: (1) legality and, (2) wisdom. The Supreme Court shall determine the  legality and Congress determines the wisdom of the President's exercise of the  power, and it is the convention that can resolve this problem. 8. Chairman Espina called on Delegate Barrera, however, requested the Members to limit their  questions to only two to allow everybody the opportunity to question the guest. 8.1 Delegate Barrera stated that the Senator is  for the discarding of the constitutional provision on the power to suspend the  privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus , but is for the  right of an organ of government to declare martial law but limited to an actual  existence of invasion, rebellion or insurrection. This was confirmed by the Senator. Delegate Barrera inquired whether the Senator  agrees or not to the fact that in places where actual fighting or actual  invasion, rebellion or insurrection exists, declaration of martial law is  unnecessary since the commander-in-chief has the full responsibility of  exercising every step necessary to protect and preserve the welfare of the  nation. 8.2 Senator Diokno replied that while it is true that the power to take all the necessary steps to  preserve peace and order and protect the people, is inherent power of  sovereignty, yet it would certainly be safer to provide his power of formal  declaration to prevent individual arbitrary exercise of power by military  commanders in the field. He stressed the need for a specific for a specific  constitutional provision which must be clearly stated and defined as to the  extent of the exercise of such powers. 9. Delegate Padua (C.) disclosed that he is an  author of a resolution removing powers of the President to suspend the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus as well as to declare martial  law, and his point of concern lies in the subsequent grant of emergency powers  that are complimentary to exercise of martial law by the President now given in  the present Constitution. He asked the  Senator whether the criterion in the exercise of martial law to actual invasion  only — that is, remove the terms ""rebellion and insurrection"" as part  of the criteria, would diminish the presidential power excesses and  abuses. Delegate Padua cited the view of Justice Fernando that people have the right to rebel, and  this would tend to justify exclusion of rebellion and insurrection as  prerequisites to impose martial law. 9.1 Senator Diokno opined that the complimentary emergency powers of the President was intended by  the Constitution to allow the President to legislate in the absence of Congress  but qualified this statement by revealing that he has not made deeper studies  along this particular point. He also  stated that the state has to have power to protect itself from any form of  change other than through constitutional processes and this concept is shared  not only by democratic but by any form of government in existence. In answer to Delegate Padua, he suggested to  define what the word rebellion in the provision mean, and the term  ""insurrection"" should be removed since insurrection is a small  rebellion, which does not merit declaration of martial law. This provision could well fit in the Bill of  Rights instead as ""the State or any portion thereof, may be placed under  martial law only in case of actual  invasion or rebellion, when the public safety so requires."" Then eliminate  the provision granting power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and place the power to  declare martial law among the powers of the President in Section 10, Article  VII, perhaps. 10. Delegate Piit sought clarification as to the stand of the Senator on the President being  already Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces, and is then capable of quelling  rebellion, therefore the power of martial law need not be specified in the  Constitution or that if it has to be, then it has to be in aid to civilian  authorities only. He further sought the Senator's opinion upon whom to lodge  the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , as well  as power to declare martial law, since he is a proponent of a form of  government that would have both a President as head of state and prime minister  as head of government. 10.1 The Senator clarified his statement to  Delegate Barrera that to declare martial law is a recognized power inherent to  the sovereignty of the state and so, need not be mentioned in the Constitution,  a case in point is the United States Constitution. In reply to the second query, he stressed  that, to him, there should not be such powers lodged on anyone anywhere. But if there has to be, the Prime Minister,  since the President is generally ceremonial officer, and would not be kept  abreast officially on every circumstance and happening of the day in the  country. 11. Delegate Siguion Reyna pointed out that from the discussions, it would be safe to assume that  the only thing that matters to an executive when he is allowed to suspend the  privilege of the writ or not, in his equivalent right to arrest and detain  people beyond the statutory requirement. He inquired whether the Senator  entertains the same thinking that the provision has outlived its usefulness since  this provision was established during the days when third degree was accepted  as a means of getting at the truth and confessions from people. In the absence of third degree method, there  is nothing to be gained in detaining people unless by the psychological idea  that a detainee would soften to confession, which is unlikely. 11.1 The Senator explained that the objective of  suspending the privilege of the writ is to hold people i ncommunicado citing as an example, the Philippines, if it is threatened by a  Red-Chinese invasion and the authorities suspected Mr. Chan, Mr. Tan, etc. to  be spies, then suspension of the privilege of the writ would enable the  government to take immediate hold of Mr. Chan, Mr. Tan and company and keep  them under detention without right to bail This would put them out of  circulation and disable their operations. The justifying reason therefore, lies in the need of the Armed Forces  for essential time to devote on the fight against the invaders or rebels  instead of consuming time to formulate charges against these detainees and the  filing of charges against these detainees can be put aside until such time when  the invasion or rebellion is under control. In short, it is to enable the Armed Forces to buy essential time. He reiterated that power to suspend the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and power to declare martial law  are justified only on actual invasion or rebellion, and he still maintained  that the former case is unnecessary. 11.2 Delegate Siguion Reyna further queried the Senator how the State can meet the security problem  in a case of imminent invasion and the power to suspend the privilege of the  writ is no longer provided for, taking as a case in point, the Philippine  situation during the period prior to the Japanese war when Japanese spies were  all over the country preparing the grounds for its invasion in Japan. How can the President or the Prime Minister meet the problem if  he has no power to suspend the privilege of the writ. 11.3 The  Senator replied that in situations like  this, the State should undertake surveillance  work as is done in the U.S. The  suspects are kept under surveillance and when enough evidence is  acquired the authorities spring the trap on them and bring them to court or in  case the suspect is found operating within an area where an actual fighting is  on, then the commander of the Armed Forces in the area, by virtue of his  inherent military power to restrict movement of civilians in the area can  apprehend and take them to custody until the fight is over without the need for  suspending the privilege of the writ. It  is part of military power. He suggested  as an alternative that a degree of flexibility in the manner of legislation can  be resorted to. Citing as an example the legislation on matters of crimes  against the security of the state, detention period prior to filing the case in  court can be enlarged. There are laws at  present falling under this category. Wire tapping is unlawful under normal  conditions but it is allowed in cases involving security and rebellion. 12. In  the follow-up clarification by Chairman De la Serna, the attention of the  Senator was directed back to his former statement that pending the privilege of  the writ only allows the government to hold the detainee incommunicado but the detainee has other rights as  the right to communicate with relatives. 12.1 Senator Diokno agreed that the detainee is still entitled to other rights as the right to be  represented by counsel, but once detained, he is subject to restrictions and  control by the jailer. 12.2 Delegate De la Serna asked if there is a  difference in the treatment of detainees when the privilege of the writ is  suspended and detainees arrested when the privilege is not suspended; Whether  to hold a person incommunicado , a jailer is under instruction to impose  certain degree of restrictions to this person which is not true with the  ordinary prisoners. 12.3 Senator Diokno replied that there was really no distinction or difference written in the law  but the jailer, in the exercise of his duty, has a certain degree of unwritten  power over his detainees. The Senator  however disclosed what happened recently to people detained which he experience  as their counsel. The lawyers were  allowed to talk to the detainees after a number of days had lapsed, and in fact  after their statements were already taken, after the process of interrogations  were terminated. He revealed that he was informed that the detainees were never  harmed nor subjected to physical pressure but the process of interrogation  continued for hours and hours, and even at an unholy hour of midnight they were awakened for further  interrogation. Methods designed to  inflict mental and physical torture to tire out the detainees. 13. The Chair recognized Delegates Molina and Mendiola who jointly engaged the Senator into a series of  interpellations regarding the Senator's personal opinions and views on the  incumbent President's exercise of his powers (Proclamation 889 and 889-A)  suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. 14. Delegate Mutuc asked the Senator if there is no difference between the Barcelon vs. the Baker case and the Montenegro vs. Castaneda cases. 14.1 The Senator replied that there was a  difference and explained: (1) In the  former case, the suspension of the privilege of the writ should not have been  done but it was done only upon joint hearing by the Philippine Commission and  the Governor - General to grant action While in the latter case, the  suspension was the exclusive action of the President of the Philippines. (2)  The situation in the former case were such that at the very beginning our  courts were manned by American Jurists intended to be later on manned by  Filipino Jurists. This being so, the courts found it hard to rule and make a  doctrine. Such action could be  interpreted as tantamount to allowing Filipino Jurists to overrule an American  Governor General and by implication, overrule the President of the U.S. since under the Jones Law, the privilege of the writ can be suspended by the  President of the U.S. This can be held later on (today) that the Filipino Supreme Court could  review the findings of the President of the U.S. ,  which is impossible under the relation between a colony and its colonizer, and  (3) that the standard of morality and truth were observed with greater fidelity  at that time than they are today. 14.2 Delegate Mutuc sought clarification in the event that the Supreme Court rules that the  anti-subversion law is not a Bill of Attainder, the Senator begged off. He stated that he preferred not to discuss  the details and merits of his position in this case, but strongly urged the  Convention to consider rewriting the provisions on the freedom of association. 15. The  Chair wanted to know whether suspension of the writ and the right to bail is  not suspended. 15.1 The Senator stated that in his opinion the  right to bail prior to filing the case in court is suspended. When the case is filed in court, the custody  of the person accused goes from the executive to the judiciary. On a follow-up  question by the Chairman seeking clarification for the distinction pointed out  by the Senator that right to bail prior to filing the case in court is  suspended, the Senator explained that the provision of the privileged of the  writ consists of the right of a person to be released if the arrest is found  illegal by court, or the detention is arbitrary or in absence of a prima  facie evidence against the person, so if the privilege of the writ is  suspended, it follows that all the other rights are also suspended. 15.2 The Chair sought the view of the Senator on  the opinion of both Secretary Abad Santos and  Solicitor Antonio that during suspension of the privilege of the writ, an order  of warrant of arrest is necessary. Senator Diokno agreed with this opinion. The Chair pointed out that if, as the Senator said,  the purpose of the privilege of the writ is to question the legality of arrest  and detention, it could be so, even if there is a valid warrant of arrest. This would seem to point out that the  issuance of the warrant of arrest is unnecessary. The Senator replied, NO, and pointed out that  if no care can be produced against a person detained, the arrest is unlawful  and the arresting officer is subject to prosecution. The suspension of the  privilege of the writ merely makes it impossible for the courts to order the  release of the detainee. The senator  agreed substantially with the observation of the Chair that this long legal  process required to be followed defeats the very purpose of the suspension of  the privilege of the writ, and stated that this is the reason the executive and  the military authorities resort to illegal shortcuts in taking people into  custody. Many of the detainees today  were not issued legal warrants, but were just invited to the military  headquarters. Because of these  observations cited, the Senator urged the joint Body to review and rewrite the  provisions on the issuance of warrants of arrest. 16. Delegate Tupaz (d.) engaged the Senator in a series of clarificatory questions which delved on points already discussed by the Senator in previous  interpellations by Delegates Mutuc , Barrera, Reyes, Laggui and Siguion Reyna. The Senator however reiterated his statement  that he is for the retention of the exercise of martial law, not that it is  less harmful, but that it is loss subject to abuse than the suspension of the  privilege of the writ. 17. Delegate Gunigundo's interpellations were on the subject of effectivity and validity of Presidential Proclamation as Proclamations No. 889 and  889-A. The Senator emphasized that the effectivity of proclamations hinges on the time it was made  public, not necessarily though that it be published in the Official Gazette,  nor copies of the contents be furnished the metropolitan newspapers for  publication. 18. Senator Diokno categorically answered Delegate Sanchez that he was suggesting a proposal to  totally remove the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in the proposed Constitution, since being silent  about it will allow Congress or the President to exercise its power of such  procedure. In answer to Delegate  Calderon (J.), he reiterated that the suspension of the writ of habeas  corpus can be exercised with or without being provided for in the  Constitution. 19. Delegate Aruego was informed by Senator Diokno that those detained  can only apply for bail if a case is filed against a detainee in court, so what  is done is to file a petition for habeas corpus , which includes the  right to bail, if the case is bailable . 20. Delegate Velez explained that he was  recommending two alternative proposals to the Executive Power Committee: 1) to prevent forever the suspension of the  privilege, or 2) to put  safeguards, meaning the President may suspend it but only in actual cases of  invasion or rebellion for a specific period of time in specific areas where  public safety requires it, with the concurrence of two-thirds vote of the  members of Congress, if in session, and if not, it will be subject to the  automatic review by the Supreme Court. 20.1 Senator Diokno was  in favor of Delegate Veles ' first proposal, however,  in the event the thinking of the Convention does not agree, the Senator did not  want to limit the President, or whoever exercises the power to suspend, for a  specific period, because it will be inflexible and meaningless. He was not agreeable to a concurrence by  Congress because he does not want to tie the hands of the President in cases of  emergency, since it is very hard to muster a quorum in both houses of Congress.  However, he was for its review by the Supreme Court. He was for the immediate proclamation, but a  limit of time should be set within which, the review should be made. 20.2 Delegate  Barrera insisted that the right to protect itself is an inherent sovereign  right of any State, so that for any organization of government to exercise  those means of protection (declaration of martial law and suspension of the  privilege of the writ) should be so stated in the Constitution, and the  necessary, safeguards provided for. 21. Delegates Barrera and Siguion Reyna engaged the Senator in a discussion criticizing the actuations of the  incumbent President in connection with the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus . ADJOURNMENT OF MEETING 22. The Chair thanked Senator Diokno for his elucidation and participation in the  discussions of the topics for the day, and adjourned the joint public hearing  at 12:10 p .m. Knowing the Government's stand and the President’s action, the  Constitutional Convention decided to retain the martial law power verbatim in the new Constitution. The framers not only ratified the validity of  the existing state of martial law but reaffirmed the President's interpretation  as the correct meaning of the constitutional provision for future occasions  requiring its exercise. The political  character of a martial law proclamation with its continuation was then  confirmed by the Constitutional Convention. The political character of continued martial law is also  sustained by the parliamentary system under the new Charter. The power to declare martial law is vested  exclusively in the Prime Minister by Article IX, Section 12. Following established precedents, such a  vesting of power is supposed to mean that its exercise is to the exclusion of  all others who may want to share in the power. In practice, however, this will no longer be true . The 1973 Constitution joined together the Executive and the  Legislative departments of the government, which were distinctly separate from  each other under the 1935 Constitution. The New Charter provides: The  legislative power shall be vested in  a National Assembly."" (Article VIII, Sec. 1) 'The Executive power shall be  exercised by the Prime Minister with the assistance of the Cabinet.""  (Article IX, Sec. 1); ""The Prime Minister shall be elected by a majority  from among themselves."" ""(Article IX, Sec. 3); ""The Prime  Minister shall appoint the Members of the Cabinet who shall be the heads of  ministries at least a majority of whom shall come from the National Assembly,  Members of the cabinet may be removed at the discretion of the Prime  Minister."" (Article IX, Sec. 4). Thus, we now have a Parliamentary system of government under the New Charter. An essential feature thereof is the direct  responsibility of the Prime Minister and the members of his Cabinet to the National Assembly, for they hold their  positions only for as long as they enjoy the confidence of the Assembly. More  accurately, Article VIII, Sec. 13(1) provides for the withdrawal of confidence  through the election of a successor or a new Prime Minister by a majority vote of all members of the  National Assembly. A Prime' Minister under the new Charter must always take into  account the desires of the National Assembly when he makes important decisions. As a matter of fact, he and  the majority of his cabinet are also members of the National Assembly.  In fact, they are the leaders of the predominant party in the legislature. They control legislative policy. The Prime Minister is responsible to the National Assembly and must execute its will on the one hand and  he its political leader and helps shape that will on the other Grave public  issues will be handled by the Executive and the Legislature acting  together. Under the new Constitution, martial law will  be a joint responsibility  of the two political departments  (executive, and legislative even if its formal proclamation is vested  solely in the Prime Minister . Before I could release this opinion, I was able to get the ""Transcript of, the Proceedings  of the 166-man Special Committee 1 Meeting  No. 8 October 27, 1972 ""  which fully sustains my view, and I quote: TRANSCRIPT OF THE PROCEEDING OF THE 166 MAN SPECIAL COMMITTEE — MEETING NO. 8 OCTOBER 27, 1972 PACE 88 — VOL. XVI — NO. 8 DELEGATE TUPAZ (A.): Section 4 — THE PRIME MINISTER SHALL BE THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF ALL ARMED  FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES AND, WHENEVER IT BECOMES NECESSARY, HE MAY CALL OUT  SUCH ARMED FORCES TO PREVENT OR SUPPRESS LAWLESS VIOLENCE, INVASION,  INSURRECTION, OR REBELLION IN CASE OF INVASION, INSURRECTION, OR REBELLION, OR  IMMINENT DANGER THEREOF, WHEN THE PUBLIC SAFETY REQUIRES IT, HE MAY SUSPEND THE  PRIVILEGE OF THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS, OR PLACE THE PHILIPPINES OR ANY PART  THEREOF UNDER MARTIAL LAW. This provision is an exact copy of a provision in the present  Constitution. This provision complement  Section 15, Article IV on the Bill of Rights of this draft. May I, therefore,  move for its approval, Mr. Chairman? CHAIRMAN DE GUZMAN (A.): Any observation or comment? Yes, Gentleman  from Batangas ? DELEGATE LEVISTE (O.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We notice, Your Honor, that in these two  sections, Section 15 of the Bill  of Rights and Section 12 of  Article IX, we are, in a way of speaking, remedying the seeming discrepancy between similar provisions in the  present Constitution. Both provisions will now contain the phrase ""or in  case of imminent danger thereof"". With such a change, I believe that no conflict as to the true intent will arise in the  future. But allow me, Your Honor, to  recall, briefly, our recent jurisprudence on the matter of the declaration of  martial law and of the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus . Your Honor will recall that under the  Jones Act, the Governor-General of the Philippines was given the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and to declare martial  law. When such power was questioned in court, the Supreme Court came out with  the decision, in the case of Barcelon vs . Baker , that the  findings of the Chief Executive on the existence of the grounds for the  declaration of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus are conclusive and may not  be inquired into by the courts. When the  Philippine Commonwealth was established under the 1935 Constitution, the  President thereof was likewise given the power to suspend the privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus and to proclaim  or declare martial law for any of the causes enumerated in the pertinent  provisions. Sometime in the 1950's, then  President Quirino suspended the privilege of the writ  of habeas corpus . When a case arose, that of Montenegro vs . Castaneda, the Supreme Court  affirmed its stand in Barcelon vs . Baker, that the assessment by the Chief Executive of the  existence of the cause or causes giving rise to the proclamation of martial law  or the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus is conclusive and may not  be contested in the courts. Recently,  however, only a little less than a year ago, when President Marcos suspended  the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus the Supreme Court ruled, in  the case of Lansang vs . Garcia and other companion cases, that the existence of  insurrection, rebellion, invasion, or imminent danger thereof, may be properly  inquired into by the courts. Now, I would like to pose before this body,  whether this Convention should now affirm the latest doctrine or whether we  should revert to the old theory and doctrine in the two cases of Barcelon vs .  Baker and Montenegro vs . Castaneda. DELEGATE TUPAZ (A.): In view of the fact that Chairman de Guzman  is also the Chairman of Subcouncil II on Citizens'  Right which conducted an exhaustive Study on this matter of martial law, may I  request that he be the one to answer queries on this point? CHAIRMAN DE GUZMAN  (A.): In that case, may I request  Delegate Tupaz to act as Chairman in the meantime? (At  this point, Chairman De Guzman yielded the Chair to Delegate Antonio Tupaz ) DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): I am personally in favor of abandoning the  doctrine laid down in the case of Lansang vs . Garcia, and I would recommend such a  view to this Committee, and to the Convention as a whole. At this very moment, the Solicitor General,  in representation of President Marcos, is urging the Supreme Court that such a  doctrine be abandoned and that we revert to the old theory laid down in the  cases mentioned by Your Honor. Indeed,  our courts, especially the Supreme Court, where these cases are invariably  taken up, are ill-equipped to make findings on the existence of rebellion,  insurrection, or lawlessness. DELEGATE LEVISTE (O.): But is not Your Honor aware that there are a  number of resolutions filed in the Convention that the Chief Executive may  suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or proclaim and declare  martial law only for a limited period and/or with the concurrence of the  Legislature? DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A): Yes, Your Honor, but we are not bound. This Committee is not bound by those  resolutions. As already agreed upon when the 166-Man Special Committee was  created, that Committee of which we are a part was merely advised to take into  consideration such resolutions. We  should bear in mind also that we are adopting the parliamentary system where  there is more, rather than less, fusion of legislative and executive  powers. We are adopting, Your Honor, the  concept and principle of an executive more directly and immediately responsible  to the Legislature so that the exercise by the Chief Executive of any of his  powers will be subject to the ever present scrutiny of the Legislature. DELEGATE LEVISTE (O.): But my point, Your Honor, is to emphasize the  fact that the filing of those resolutions requiring even the concurrence of the  National Assembly for the valid exercise by the Prime Minister of these  extraordinary constitutional prerogatives indicates that there is a sentiment  among the Delegates to further restrict, rather than expand, the powers. And I would say that the decision of the  Supreme Court in Lansang vs . Garcia, which repudiated the doctrine earlier laid down in  Baker and Castaneda lends support to that sentiment. If we are to interpret the provision under  consideration in the way Your Honor would want it interpreted, in the sense  that the factual findings of the Chief Executive for the suspension of the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or the declaration of martial law  would be conclusive insofar as the judicial Department is concerned, then we  are retrogressing and, in effect, going against the sentiment to further  restrict the exercise of these great constitutional powers. DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): I can go along with Your Honor's argument if,  as I have already stated, this Convention opted for the presidential form of  government. But as we have already opted  and chosen the parliamentary system, I think further restriction on the powers  of the Chief Executive will no longer be justified. It will be trite to repeat here, but I repeat  them nevertheless, the arguments in favor of a parliamentary form of  government: that this system is for a  strong executive, but one who is immediately and instantly answerable to his  peers at all times. Thus, should a Prime  Minister suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or declare  martial law arbitrarily or, even perhaps, irrationally, I don't think that  there can be any better or more immediate check on such arbitrary and  irrational exercise of power than the Parliament itself. The courts cannot pretend to be in a better  position than the Parliament in this regard. For the Parliament on the very day, or perhaps even on the very hour,  that the Prime Minister proclaims martial law or suspends the privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus may file a motion to depose him and should this  motion be successful, then the prevailing party with its Prime Minister will  just issue another proclamation restoring normalcy and order. DELEGATE LEVISTE (Q): Thank you, Your Honor. For the moment, Mr. Chairman, I have no more,  questions to ask. PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.): Are there any further comments or  interpellations? DELEGATE QUIRINO: just one question, Mr. Chairman, in  connection with the point raised by Delegate Leviste . PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.): You may proceed. DELEGATE QUIRINO: Before I ask my question, Your Honor, let me  state my position clearly lest I be misunderstood. I am asking this question not because I  disagree with Your Honor's position but only for the purpose of enriching this  debate with exchanges of views for future researchers and scholars. Now, if, as Your Honor puts it, the decision  of the Prime Minister on the existence of grounds justifying the declaration of  martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus would no longer be opened to judicial scrutiny, would that not enable the Prime  Minister to abuse his powers? DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): Your Honor was not listening. I just stated  that there is a more immediate check on the part of the Parliament, and aside  from this practical check, it must be understood that an act of the Chief  Executive suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or  proclaiming martial law is a political act and may not therefore be legally  questioned in court. It being a  political act, the remedy must also be political, in a political forum, be it  in the Parliament or directly before our people. And it must be stated that there is no power  which may not be abused. I think, Your  Honor, we should once and for all agree as to the nature of this power we are  investing in the Chief Executive. Once  and for all, we should agree that this power is eminently political and  executive in nature. The Judiciary, I  submit, is not the best, much less is it the most practical agency, to possess,  to exercise, or to limit this power, need for which cannot be denied. DELEGATE QUIRINO: Well, Your Honor, I am not a lawyer, so I hope you will pardon me if I cannot  fully appreciated what you are talking about. Because, to me, an act is political if it is done by a politician. That's all, Mr. Chairman. PRESIDING OFFICER TOPAZ (A.): Let's be serious, please. All right, are there further interpellations  or comments? Yes, Delegate Ortiz, what is it that you want to ask? DELEGATE  ORTIZ (A.): Well, Mr. Chairman,  this is not a question but just  additional observations. It is  unfortunate really that the doctrine first laid down in Barcelon vs Baker and affirmed more than half a century later in Montenegro vs . Castaneda was reversed by the  Supreme Court in Lansang vs . Garcia , I say it is unfortunate because more than anyone else, only  the President is in the best position to evaluate and assess the existence of  the causes which would warrant the exercise of this constitutional power. As it were, the Prime Minister is the head of  the Executive Department. More than  that, he is the Commander-in-Chief of all the armed forces of the Philippines . He has, therefore, all the resources and  facilities not available to any other official of the government, much less too  the Supreme Court, to make authoritative findings and assessments of the  threats to national security. But even  in the Lansang case, I would say that the Court had  to rely on the findings of the Executive Department. I have  here a copy of the decision of the Supreme Court in that case, and I would say  that the Court had to rely on the findings of the Executive Department. I have here a copy of the decision of the  Supreme Court in that case, and I would like to quote a portion thereof. In this decision, the Supreme court stated,  and I quote: In the year 1969, the NPA had — according to the records of the  Department of National Defense — conducted raids, resorted to kidnapping and  taken part in other violent incidents, summing over 230, in which it inflicted 404 casualties and, in turn, suffered 243 losses. In 1970, its  record of violent incidents was about the same but the NPA casualties more than  doubled. I  wish to call the attention of the Members of this Committee to the phrase  appearing in this portion of the court's decision, namely, ""according to  the records of the Department of National Defense"". This phrase is, to me, significant in the  sense that even the Supreme Court itself had to rely on the records of an  agency of the Executive Department, which only proves or, at least indicates an  admission on the part of the Court that by itself, it is not in a position to  make its own factual findings on the grounds justifying the suspension of the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in the Lansang case. In short, even in the Lansang case where the Supreme Court repudiated the  conclusiveness of executive findings on facts to justify the exercise of the  power, the same court, nonetheless, had to resort to such findings made by an  arm of the Executive Department. If I  may further add, I would like to say that, to my recollection, during that  hearing when the Supreme Court received this evidence, or perhaps we may call  them pieces of information, from the military, which information was  classified, there was objections on the part of some counsel who were excluded  from the hearing, to the effect that they should also be afforded the  opportunity of hearing such information. All of these, of course, merely show the impracticability on the part of any court, be it the  Supreme Court or a lower court, to receive evidence which is, perhaps, not even  acceptable under the Rules of Court and, thereafter, to determine for itself  whether such evidence or information is legally sufficient for the President or  the Prime Minister to act upon. We are  therefore here abandoning the Lansang doctrine. SOME DELEGATES: No objection! No objection! DELEGATE ADIL: So, it is then the understanding of this Commitee , and I take if to be its position, that when the  Prime Minister suspends the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or declares  martial law, the findings by the Prime Minister on the causes that justify such  suspension or proclamation are conclusive and may not, therefore, be inquired  into by the courts. DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A): May not be inquired into by the courts or by  anyone, and Chief Executive is fully responsible for his acts. The courts, of course, are powerless to take  remedies against any arbitrary acts of the Chief Executive, but such arbitrary  act, if there be any, may be checked by the political branch or department of  the government and, ultimately, by the people themselves. DELEGATE LEVISTE (O.): If that is our understanding, Your Honor, why  don't we put it here, in black and white, that the findings of the Prime  Minister on the existence of the grounds for the suspension of the privilege of  the writ of habeas corpus or the proclamation of martial law are conclusive  upon the courts? PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.): Your Honor, I suppose you are aware that we  are here drafting a Constitution and not annotating an existing one. If we are to include in this document every  intent and interpretation we have on each provision, I cannot imagine the kind  of bulk of such Constitutional which we shall submit to our people. DELEGATE LEVISTE (O): I made that suggestion, Your Honor, because I  want to leave no doubt on our position regarding this point. PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.): Well, I think the records of our  deliberations here would suffice to erase that doubt. DELEGATE LEVISTE (O): Now, Mr. Chairman, if I may go to another  point, I would like to inquire whether this provision on the powers of the  Chief Executive or the Prime Minister concerning the declaration of martial law  is limited to the quelling or the suppression of rebellion, insurrection, invasion  or lawlessness, or whether such a power includes in it the establishment of a  new order of things, a new society. I  say this, Your Honor, because on the evening President Marcos announced the  proclamation of martial law, he underscored his action by saying that he  proclaimed martial law in order, according to him, ""to save the Republic  and form a New Society"". PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.):. Delegate  De Guzman will please answer that. DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): The question; Your Honor, brings to the fore  the nature and concept of martial law. As it is understood by recognized authorities on the subject, martial  law rests upon the doctrine of paramount necessity. The controlling consideration, Your Honor, is  necessity. The crucial consideration is  the very existence of the State, the very existence of the Constitution and the  laws upon which depend the rights of the citizens, and the condition of peace  and order so basic to the continued enjoyment of such rights. Therefore, from this view of the nature of  martial law, the power is to be exercised not only for the more immediate  object of quelling the disturbance or meeting a public peril which, in the  first place, caused the declaration of martial law, but also to prevent the  recurrence of the very causes which necessitated the declaration of martial  law. Thus, Your Honor, I believe that  when President Marcos, to cite the domestic experience, declared that he  proclaimed Martial law to save the Republic and to form a New Society, he was  stating the full course which martial law must have to take in order to achieve  its rational end. Because in the  particular case of the Philippine situation, I agree with the President that it  is not enough that we be able to quell the rebellion and the lawlessness, hut that  we should also be able to eliminate the many ills and evils in society which  have, in the first place, bred and abetted the rebellion and the lawlessness. DELEGATE LEVISTE (O):): I agree with you wholeheartedly, Your  Honor. That's all, Mr. Chairman. DELEGATE ADIL: It seems, Your honor, that we are  revolutionizing the traditional concept of martial law which is commonly  understood as a weapon to combat lawlessness and rebellion through the use of  the military authorities. If my  understanding is correct, Your Honor, martial law is essentially the  substitution of military power for civilian authorities in areas where such  civilian authorities are unable to discharge their functions due to the  disturbed peace and order conditions therein. But with your explanation, Your Honor, it seems that the martial law  administrator, ever if he has it the meantime succeeded in quelling the  immediate threats to the security of the state, could take measures no longer  in the form of military operations but essentially and principally of the  nature of ameliorative social action. DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): His Honor is correct when he said that we are  abandoning the narrow, traditional and classic concept of martial law. But we are abandoning the same only to humanize  it. For Your Honor will recall that the  old concept of martial law is that the law of the camp is the law of the land,  which we are not ready to accept, and President Marcos, aware as he is, that  the Filipino people will not countenance any suppressive and unjust action,  rightly seeks not only to immediately quell and break the back of the rebel  elements but to form a New Society, to create a new atmosphere which will not  be a natural habitat of discontent. State otherwise, the concept of martial law, as now being practiced, is  not only to restore peace and order in the streets and in the towns but to  remedy the social and political environments, in such a way that discontent  will not once more be renewed. DELEGATE ORTIZ (R.); I can feel from the  discussion. Mr. Chairman, that we are  having difficulty in trying to ascertain the scope and limitations of martial  law. To my mind, Mr. Chairman, it is  constitutionally impossible for us to place in this great document, in black  and white, the limits and the extent of martial law. We are framing a Constitution and not a  statute and unlike a statute, a Constitution must limit itself to providing  basic concepts and policies without going into details. I have heard from some of the Delegates here  their concern that we might be, by this provision and the interpretations being  given to it, departing from the traditional concept of martial law. Concepts are mere concepts, Mr. Chairman, but  concepts, like principles, must be tested by their application to existing  conditions, whether those concepts are contained in statutes or in a  Constitution. Referring specifically to the exercise of his power by President  Marcos, doubts have been expressed in some quarters, whether in declaring  martial law he could exercise legislative and  judicial powers. I would want to  emphasize that the circumstances which provoked the President in declaring  martial law may not be quantified. In  fact, it is completely different from a case of invasion where the threat to  national security comes from the outside. The martial law declared by the President was occasioned by the acts of  rebellion, subversion lawlessness and chaos that are widespread in the  country. Their origin, therefore, is  internal. There was no threat from  without, but only from within. But these  acts of lawlessness, rebellion, and subversion are mere manifestation of more  serious upheavals that beset the deepest core of our social order. If we shall limit and constrict martial law  to its traditional concept, in the sense that the military will be merely called upon to discharge civilian  functions in areas where the civil functionaries are not in a position to  perform their normal duties or, better still, to quell lawlessness and restore  peace and order, then martial law would be a mere temporary palliative and we  shall be helpless if bound by the old maxim that martial law is the public law  of military necessity, that necessity calls it forth, that necessity justifies  its existence, and necessity measures the extent and degrees to which it may be  employed. My point here, Your Honor, is  that beyond martial necessity lies the graver problem of solving the maladies  which, in the first place, brought about the conditions which precipitated the  exercise of his martial authority, will be limited to merely taking a military  measure to quell the rebellion and eliminating lawlessness in the country and  leave him with no means of authority to effect the needed social and economic  reforms to create an enduring condition of peace and order, then we shall have  failed in providing in this Constitution the basic philosophy of martial law  which. I am sure, we are embodying in it  for the great purpose of preserving the State. I say that the preservation of the State is not limited merely to eliminating  the threats that immediately confront it. More than that, the measure to preserve the State must go deeper into  the root causes of the social disorder that endanger the general safety. DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): I need not add more, Mr. Chairman, to the  very convincing remarks of my good friend and colleague, Delegate Ortiz. And I take it, Mr. Chairman, that that is  also the position of this Committee. PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.): Yes, also this Committee. DELEGATE ADIL: Just one more question, Mr. Chairman, if the distinguished  Delegate from La Union would oblige. DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): All the time, Your Honor. DELEGATE ADIL: When martial law is proclaimed Your Honor,  would it mean that the Constitution, which authorizes such proclamation, is set  aside or that at least, some provisions of the Constitution are suspended? DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): The Constitution not set aside, but the  operation of some of its provisions must,  of necessity, be restricted, if not suspended because their continuance  is inconsistent with the proclamation of martial law. For instance, some civil liberties will have  to be suspended upon the proclamation of martial law, not because we do not value  them but simply because it is impossible to implement these civil liberties  hand-in-hand with the effective and successful exercise and implementation of  martial powers. There are certain  individual rights which must be restricted and curtailed because their exercise  and enjoyment would negate the implementation of martial authority. The preservation of the State and its  Constitution stands paramount over certain individual rights and freedom. As it were,  the Constitution provides martial law as its weapon for survival and when the occasion arises, when such is at  stake, prudence requires that certain individual rights must have to be  sacrificed temporarily. For indeed, the  destruction of the Constitution would mean the destruction of all the rights  that flow from it. DELEGATE ADIL: Does Your Honor mean to say that when martial  law is declared and I, for instance am detained by the military authorities, I  cannot avail of the normal judicial processes to obtain my liberty and question  the legality of my detention? DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): If I am not mistaken, Your Honor, you are  referring to the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. DELEGATE ADIL: Yes. Your Honor, that is correct. DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): In that case, Your Honor, I take it that when  martial law is proclaimed, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is ipso  facto suspended and, therefore, if you are apprehended and detained by the  military authorities, more so. when your apprehension and detention were for an  offense against the security of the State, then you cannot invoke the privilege  of the writ of habeas corpus and ask the courts to order your temporary  release. The privilege of the writ of  habeas corpus, like some other individual rights, must have to yield to the  greater need of preserving the State. Here, we have to make a choice between two values, and I say that in  times of great peril, when the very safety of the whole nation and this  Constitution is at stake, we have to elect for the greater one. For,  as have said, individual rights assume meaning and importance only when  their exercise could be guaranteed by the State, and such guaranty cannot  definitely be had unless the State is in a position to assert and enforce its  authority. DELEGATE ADIL: Since martial law was declared by President  Marcos last September 21, 1972, and announced on September 23, 1972 , the President has been issuing decrees  which are in the nature of statutes, regulating as they do, various and  numerous norms of conduct of both the private and the public sectors. Would you say, Your Honor, that such exercise  of legislative powers by the President is within his martial law authority? DELGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): Certainly, and that is the  position of this Committee. As martial  law administrator and by virtue of his position as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed  Forces, the President could exercise legislative and, if I may add, some  judicial powers to meet the martial situation. The Chief Executive must not be harmstrung or  limited to his traditional powers as Chief Executive. When martial law, declared, the declaration  gives rise to the birth of powers, not strictly executive in character, but  nonetheless necessary and incident to the assumption of martial law authority  to the end that the State may be safe. DELEGATE ADIL: I am not at all questioning the  constitutionality of the President's assumption of powers which are not  strictly executive in character. Indeed,  I can concede that when martial law is declared, the President can exercise  certain judicial and legislative powers which are essential to or which have to  do with the quelling of rebellion, insurrection, imminent danger thereof, or  meeting an invasion. What appears  disturbing to me, and which I want Your Honor to convince me further, is the  exercise and assumption by the President or by the Prime Minister of powers,  either legislative or judicial in character, which have nothing to do with the  conditions of rebellion, insurrection, invasion or imminent danger thereof. To be more specific. Your Honor, and to cite to you an example, I  have in mind the decree issued by the President proclaiming a nationwide land  reform or declaring land reform throughout the Philippines . I suppose you will agree with me, Your Honor,  that such a decree, or any similar decree for that matter, has nothing to do  with invasion, insurrection, rebellion or imminent danger thereof. My point, Your Honor, is that this measure  basically has nothing to do with the restoration of peace and order or the  quelling of rebellion or insurrection. How could we validly say that the President's assumption of such powers  is justified by the proclamation of martial law? DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): As I have repeatedly stated, Your Honor, we  have now to abandon the traditional concept of martial law as it is understood  in some foreign textbooks. We have to  look at martial law not as an immutable principle. Rather, we must view it in the light of our  contemporary experience and not in isolation thereof. The quelling of rebellion or lawlessness or,  in other words, the restoration of peace and order may admittedly be said to be  the immediate objective of martial law, but that is to beg the question. For how could there really be an enduring peace  and order if the very causes which spawned the conditions which necessitated  the exercise of martial powers are not remedied? Your cite as an example the  decree on land reform. Your Honor will  have to admit that one of the major causes of social unrest among the peasantry  in our society is the deplorable treatment society has given to our peasants. As early as the 1930's the peasants have been agitating for agrarian reforms to  the extent that during the time of President Qurino they almost succeeded in overthrowing the government by force. Were we to adopt the traditional concept of  martial law, we would be confined to merely putting clown one peasant uprising  after another, leaving unsolved the maladies that in the main brought forth  those uprisings. If we are really to  establish an enduring condition of peace and order and assure through the ages  the stability of our Constitution and the Republic, I say that martial law,  being the ultimate weapon of survival provided for in the Constitution, must  penetrate deeper and seek to alleviate and cure the ills and the seething  furies deep in the bowels of the social structure. In a very real sense,  therefore, there is a profound relationship between the exercise by the martial  law administrator of legislative and judicial powers and the ultimate objective  of martial law. And I may add that in  the ultimate analysis, the only known limitation to martial law powers is the  convenience of the martial law administrator and the judgment and verdict of  the people and, of course, the verdict of history itself. DELEGATE LEVISTE (O.): Your Honor, just for purposes of discussion,  may I know from you whether there has been an occasion in this country where  any past President had made use of his martial law power? DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): I am glad that you asked that question, Your  Honor, because it seems that we are of the impression that since its  incorporation into the 1935 Constitution  the martial law provision has never been availed of by any President. I recall, Your Honor, that during the  Japanese occupation. President Laurel  had occasion to declare martial law he also assumed legislative and judicial  powers. We must, of course, realize that  during the time of President Laurel, the threats to national security which  precipitated the declaration came from the outside. The threats, therefore, were not internal in  origin and character as those which prompted President Marcos to issue his  historic proclamation. If, in case — as  what happened during the time of  President Laurel — the declaration of martial law necessitated the  exercise of legislative powers by the martial law administrator, I say that  greater necessity calls forth the exercise of that power when the threats to  national security are posed not by invaders but by the rebellious and seditious  elements both of the left and right, from within. I say that because every rebellion, whether  in this country or in other foreign countries, is usually the product of social  unrest and dissatisfaction with the established order. Rebellions or the acts of rebellion are  usually preceded by long suffering of those who ultimately choose to rise in  arms against the government. A rebellion  is not born overnight. It is the result  of an accumulation of social sufferings on the part of the rebels until they can  no longer stand those sufferings to the point that, like a volcano, it must  sooner erupt. In this context, the  stamping out of rebellion must not be the main and only objective of martial  law. The Martial law administrator  should, nay, must, take steps to remedy the crisis that lie behind the  rebellious movement, even if in the process, he should exercise legislative and  judicial powers. For what benefit would  it be after having put down a rebellion through the exercise of martial power  if another rebellion is again the offing because the root causes which  propelled the movement are ever present? One might succeed in capturing the  rebel leaders and their followers, imprison them for life or, better skill,  kill them in the field, but someday new leaders will pick up the torch and the  tattered banners and lead another movement. Great causes of every human undertaking do not usually die with the men  behind those causes. Unless the root  causes are themselves eliminated, there will be a resurgence of another  rebellion and, logically, the endless and vicious exercise of martial law  authority. This reminds me of the wise  words of an old man in our town: That if  you are going to clear your field of weeds and grasses, you should not merely  cut them, but dig them out. PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A): With the Indulgence of the Gentlemen from La  Union, the Chair would want to have a recess for at least ten minutes. DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In fact, I was about to move for it after the  grueling interpellations by some of our colleagues here, but before we recess, may I move for the approval of Section 4? PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.): Are there any objections? There being none, Section 4 is approved. It is for the foregoing reasons  that I find continued martial law to be a political question under the new Charter. The present Constitution does not give the Supreme Court any  power to check the exercise of a supremely political prerogative. If there is any checking or review of martial law, the Constitution gives  it, not to the Supreme Court, but to the National Assembly. Ultimately, the checking function is vested  in the people. Whether the National  Assembly expresses displeasure and withdraw its confidence from the Prime  Minister through election of a successor or the Prime Minister asks the  President to dissolve the National Assembly under Article VIII , Section 13, the issue of martial law ultimately rests with the  people. Anything dependent upon the  popular will is, of course political. Although the interim National Assembly has not yet been convened, the  intent of the Constitutional Convention to make the question political is  clear. Exclusive of the Transitory Provisions, other provisions of the  present Charter may be cited. The Bill  of Rights, Article IV, Section 15 had  added ""or imminent danger thereof"" to the 1935 provision. It now  reads — SEC. 15. The privilege of  the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion,  insurrection, rebellion, or imminent danger thereof , when the  public safety requires it. Article IX, Section 16, another new provision reads-- SEC. 16. All powers vested  in the President of the Philippines under the nineteen hundred and thirty-five Constitution and the laws of the  land which are not herein provided for or conferred upon any official shall be  deemed, and are hereby, vested in the Prime Minister, unless the National  Assembly provides otherwise. All the foregoing features of the new Constitution strengthen and  do not decrease the exclusivity, and political nature of the power to proclaim  martial law and to lift it. XIV GRANTING THAT THE CONTINUATION OF MARTIAL LAW IS NOT  POLITICAL BUT JUSTICIABLE, IT IS STILL VALID UNDER THE TEST OF ARBITRARINESS. Even if we grant that the continuation of martial law and the  determination when to lift it are justiciable in  character, Our decision is still the same. Correctness of the President's acts, I must repeat, is not the  test. Assuming that the Court has  jurisdiction to determine when martial law should be lifted, the test is still  arbitrariness. Aside from asserting that there was no basis for the initial  proclamation of martial law, the petitioners insist there is no real emergency  in the country today. Petitioner Diokno cites various newspaper  items reporting statements of the President and defense officials. Among them are assurances of the President  that reservists won't undergo combat duty, statements of Defense Secretary  Ponce Enrile citing gains in peace and order,  disclosures, of commanding generals that the Mindanao rebellion is crushed and Tarlac is now peaceful, and  reports from Nueva Ecija that the rebel backbone is broken. (Supplemental Petition and Motion for  Immediate Release dated June 29, 1973.) The petitioners assert that the ""actual state of war""  aspect was dropped from general orders as early as September 30, 1972 and that the transformation of  a New Society has become the new theme. It is the second purpose — the building of a New Society — that is  now being emphasized everywhere. The  instruments of mass communication that have been allowed to often drum this  theme without ceasing. Very little space  and time is devoted now to the idea of saving the Republic. One can, of course, handle this difficulty by  a semantic manipulation, namely, that the building of a New Society is the only  way of saving the Republic. In a Manifestation dated July   8, 1974 , petitioner Diokno cites other  circumstances showing that peace and order conditions in the country are  normal. 1. The President  left the country a few weeks ago for a meeting at Menado with President Suharto of Indonesia ,  something he obviously would not have done if there really was an emergency. 2. Tourists and  foreign investors are coming to our shores in hordes, not just to Manila but also its environs and outlaying provinces, which they would certainly not  do if they were not assured of security stability. 3. Basketball, chess, swimming and even karate  international tournaments are being held in the Philippines . The President even attended the latter event. 4. The 1974 Miss Universe contest is scheduled to  be held in Manila this month with  expenses in preparation therefor amounting to million  of pesos. The Government would not have  been so thoughtless as to spend so much money for such an unnecessary affair,  if there is really an ""actual and imminent danger of insurrection and  rebellion."" 5. Since the proclamation of martial law, the  Philippines has hosted several international conference the latest being the  United Nations Development Program session which were attended by delegates and  observers from sixty-six (66) countries, twenty-six (26) United Nations  Agencies, and the U.N.D.P. Secretariat. The event last mentioned brought in so  many visitors that facilities of no less than fourteen (14) hotels had to be  utilized. This can only happen in a country where peace and tranquility  prevail. These circumstances, — some bordering on the frivolous, coupled  with the President's clear and repeated assurance that there is ""no real  emergency today"" (Daily Express, June 22, 1973) and that ""actually We  have removed"" martial law (Time Magazine, April 15,1974) —all confirm  that the conditions under which ""persons may be detained without warrant  but with due process"" (to use the quotation from petitioner's cited by  respondents), no longer exist, if indeed they ever existed, and that,  therefore, the power of indefinite detention claimed by the Solicitor General  and the respondents for the President in their last two pleadings, is actually  and patently ""beyond the pale of the law because it is violative of the human rights guaranteed by the Constitution."" While I believe that the continuation of a state of martial law  is a political question under the new Constitution, these arguments deserve  answer for the sake of our people who will read the Court's decision. I am not convinced, at this stage of martial law, that the  President is acting arbitrarily in not lifting the proclamation. A Manifestation dated May   13, 1974 from the respondents states: a. Pursuant to the President's constitutional  powers, functions, and responsibilities in a state of martial law, he  periodically requires to he conducted a continuing assessment of the factual  situation which necessitated the promulgation of Proclamation No. 1081 on  September 21, 1972 and the continuation of martial law through Proclamation  No.1104, dated January 17, 1973. b. The Government's current and latest  assessment of the situation including evidence of the subversive activities of  various groups and individuals, indicates that there are still pockets of  actual armed insurrection and rebellion in certain parts of the country. While in the major areas of the active  rebellion the military challenge to the Republic and its duly constituted Government  has been overcome and effective steps have been and are being taken to redress  the centuries-old and deep-seated causes upon which the fires of insurrection  and rebellion have fed, the essential process of rehabilitation and renascence is a slow and delicate  process. On the basis of said current  assessment and of consultations with the people, the President believes that  the exigencies of the situation, the continued threat to peace, order, and  security the dangers to stable government and to democratic processes and  institutions, the requirements of public safety, and the actual and imminent  danger of insurrection and rebellion all require the continuation of the  exercise of powers incident to martial law: c. The majority of persons who had to be detained  upon the proclamation of martial law have been released and are now engaged in  their normal pursuits. However, the President has deemed that, considering the  overall situation described above and in view of adequate evidence which can  not now be declassified, the continued detention of certain individuals without  the filing of formal charges in court for subversive and other criminal acts is  necessary in the interest of national security and defense to enable the  Government to successfully meet the grave threats of rebellion and  insurrection. In this regard, the  Secretary of National Defense and his authorized representatives have acted in  accordance with guidelines relating to national security which the President  has prescribed. The President believes that the continued threat to peace and order, the dangers to  stable government and democratic institutions and the actual and imminent  danger of insurrection and rebellion require continuation of martial law. This finding is based on a continuing assessment  of the factual situation which resulted in Proclamation No. 1081. On the other hand, petitioners believe  otherwise. In the exercise of judicial review, one reasonable mind assessing  the factual situation now obtaining could probably agree with the  petitioners. Another reasonable mind,  however, viewing the same factual situation could very understandably arrive at  an opposite conclusion. Assuming We have  the power, We should not try to weigh evidence on either side and determine who  is correct and who is wrong. As stated  earlier, the test of validity is arbitrariness and not correctness. I do not doubt the President's sincerity and  good faith in making the determination outlined in the respondent's  Manifestation. There can, therefore, be  no finding that he is acting arbitrarily in not lifting martial law. The ""evidence"" presented by petitioner Diokno weakens his arguments. If, as he claims, the mass media are  controlled, the news items on rebellion that he cites should not be accorded  strong probative value. It is possible  that the news about rebels and insurrectionist activities is deliberately  played down as part of the peace and order campaign under Martial law. The  news could be intended to convince those who may waver between seeking  amnesty or prolonging the rebellion to take the first course of action. In fact, there is overwhelming a greater number of reasonable men  and women who agree with the President's findings than with the petitioners'  convictions. On July 27, 1973 and July 28, 1973 , voters in a national referendum were asked  — Do you want President Marcos to continue beyond 1973 and finish the reforms  he has initiated under martial law? The Commission on Elections has reported  that 18,505,216 voters answered ""Yes"" and 1,858,744 voted  ""No"". The vote of the  18,505.216 people from all parts of the country who answered ""Yes""  can clearly be interpreted as sustaining the finding that the President is not  acting arbitrarily. In fact, it can be  read in no other way but to confirm  even the correctness of the President's determination on the continuing need  for martial law. And since other  referendum are forthcoming, a more reliable gauge of arbitrariness and  correctness than press clippings is available to our people as they judge the  President. The petitioners in urging this Court to decide the petitions and  to decide them in their favor, raise the alarm that unless We do so. We may never be able to decide at all. We are warned that ""in the face of an  assault on the judiciary, it would be ridiculous, if it were not tragic, if  this Court did not even so much as defend itself . . . In the face of a  dismantling of the entire constitutional order of which the judiciary is a  vital, indispensable part, how can it even afford the luxury of acquiescence in  its own ruin? And now can it continue to inspire the high respect of the  people, if it merely indulges in sculptured rhetoric and fails to protect their  civil liberties in live, concrete petitions such an this?"" (Reply  Memorandum for Petitioners dated November 30, 1972, page 40). The petitioners speak of ""constitutional  suicide"" (ibid. p. 60) and allege that ""the gloom deepens and is  encircling, and only a few lights remain. One remaining light is that provided by this Supreme Tribunal. The entire nation now looks in its direction  and prayerfully hopes it will continue burning"" (ibid. p. 81). I do not share the  same doomsday impressions about martial law. My decision is based not alone on my sincere conviction about what the  Constitution commands and what the relevant constitutional provisions  mean. Happily, my reading of the  Constitution as a legal document coincides with what I feel is right, morally  and conscience-wise, for our country and people. It confirms my life-long conviction that there  is indeed wisdom, profundity and even genius in the seemingly short and  uncomplicated provisions of our fundamental law. XV MARTIAL LAW AND THE SUSPENSION OF THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS Another issue in the instant petitions is whether the privilege  of the writ of habeas corpus is suspended upon a proclamation of martial  law. The answer is obviously in the  affirmative. The proclamation of martial law is conditioned on the occurrence  of the gravest contingencies. The  exercise of a more absolute power necessarily includes the lesser power  especially where it is needed to make the first power effective. ""The suspension enables the executive,  without interference from the courts or the law, to arrest and imprison persons  against whom no legal crime can be proved, but who may, nevertheless. be  effectively engaged in forming the rebellion or inviting the invasion, to the  imminent danger of the public safety."" ( Barcelon vs . Baker, 5 Phil. 87. 112). It would negate the effectivity of martial law if detainees could go to the courts and ask for release  under the same grounds and following the same procedure obtaining in normal  times. The President in the dispositive paragraph of Proclamation No. 1081 ordered that  all persons presently detained or others who may thereafter be similarly  detained for the crimes of insurrection and rebellion and all other crimes and  offenses committed in furtherance or on the occasion or in connection therewith  shall be kept under detention until otherwise ordered released by him or his  duly designated representative. Under  General Order No. 2-A, the President ordered the arrest and taking into custody  of certain individuals. General Order  No. 2-A directs that these arrested individuals will be held in custody until  otherwise ordered by the  President or his duly designated representative. These general orders clearly show that the  President was precluding court examination into these specified arrest and  court orders directing release of detained individuals. Martial law is intended to overcome the  dangers from rebellion or insurrection. The purpose would be subverted if martial law is declared and yet  individuals committing acts of direct rebellion and insurrection or acts which  further the goals of the rebels cannot be detained without filing charges. If the President decides to proclaim martial  law and to use all the military forces of the Philippines to preserve the Republic and safeguard the interests of the people, it is  sophistry to slate that the lesser power of suspending the privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus is not included. This is especially true where, as in these cases, the President has  specifically ordered the detention without filing of charges of individuals who  further or might further the rebellion. This appears clear from Proclamation No. 1081 itself and from pertinent  general orders issued pursuant to it. XVI THE EFFECT OF ARTICLE XVII, SEC. 3 (2) OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION There is another reason for denying the instant petitions. Article XVII, Section 3, Subsection (2) of the present  Constitution (ratified on January 17,   1973 ) has transitory provision which reads: (2) All proclamations, orders, decrees,  instructions, and acts promulgated, issued, or done by the incumbent President  shall be part of the law of the land, and shall remain valid, legal, binding,  and effective even after lifting of martial law or the ratification of this  Constitution, unless modified, revoked, or superseded by subsequent  proclamations, other acts of the incumbent President or unless expressly and or  explicitly modified or repealed by the regular National Assembly. It is noted from the foregoing that all proclamations and orders  of the President, specifically Proclamation No. 1081 and the relevant orders  and decrees affecting the herein petitioners and others similarly situated, are  by the express words of the Constitution, part of the law of the land. In fact, the transitory provision considers  them valid, legal, binding and effective even after lifting of martial law or  the ratification of this Constitution. They are valid not only at the inception of but also during martial  law. Only an express and explicit  modification or repeal by the regular National Assembly may modify, revoke, and  supersede the proclamation orders, decrees, instructions or other acts of the  incumbent President under martial law. This transitory provision does not, as many people believe, merely  validate Proclamation No. 1081. This  section confirms the validity of the proclamation under the old Constitution  and its continuing validity under the New Constitution. The Constitutional Convention concurred with  the President and declared that the proclamation was validly issued under the  old Charter and continues to be constitutional under the new Constitution. On the basis of the constitutional provision  alone, the declaration of martial law under Proclamation No. 1081 may,  therefore, be justified and validated. Similarly, the orders of the President on the continued detention of the  petitioners and, in effect, the suspension of the privilege of the writ of  habeas corpus have been definitely declared valid and constitutional. I wish to add that with the above-cited portion of t he Transitory Provision, the  Constitutional Convention wanted to foreclose any constitutional attack on the  validity of ""all proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions, and acts  promulgated, issued, or done by the incumbent President"" mentioned  therein. As a matter of fact, during the  discussion of this portion of the Transitory Provision before the 166-man  special committee, formed to finally draft the Constitution of which I was a  member, (being the Vice-Chairman of the panel of floor leaders), answering a  query from Delegate Leviste , Delegate Pacificador said: TRANSCRIPT OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE 166-MAN SPECIAL COMMITTEE — MEETING NO. 33 NOVEMBER 26, 1972 ""By the provisions of Subsection 2, we are rendering the decrees of the incumbent President as  more than mere statutes. We are  constituting them as highly political acts, the validity of which cannot be  inquired into even by our courts, but are appealable only to the people themselves. There will be no other way of revoking or repealing such decrees except by the two  ways mentioned in Subsection 2 of Section 3."" Justifying martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus by citing the transitory provisions of the present  Constitution leads to another argument in the petitions. According to petitioner Diokno ,  the statements in the dispositive portion of the  decision in the ratification cases that ""there is no further judicial  obstacle to the new Constitution being considered in force and effect"" is  clearly, not a ruling that the New Constitution is legally in force and effect. Petitioner Diokno stresses how carefully the Court, has chosen its language. According to him, the Court does not say that  there is no further legal obstacle and that it says merely that there is no  further judicial obstacle. Petitioner finds a world of difference  between a legal and a judicial obstacle. Every illegal act, according to him, is per se barred by a legal obstacle  but not necessarily by a judicial obstacle. The petitioner points out that the Court does not state that the new  Constitution is in force and effect. It merely  speaks of the new Constitution being considered in  force and in effect. He alleges that  between ""being"" and ""being considered"", there is again a  world of difference. From the decision  of the Supreme Court in the ratification cases, the petitioner believes that  the Court was trying to make it as plain as circumstances permitted that it had  not decided that the new Constitution is legally and factually in force. Other pleadings submitted in these cases have raised basically  the same major issues that were raised in the ratification cases already  decided by the Court. To my mind, the dispositive portion of  the Supreme Court's decision is best interpreted by the Supreme Court  itself. No amount of argumentation,  submission of pleadings, play of words, and semantic niceties can overcome or  ignore the fact that the Supreme Court is interpreting and applying the new  Constitution. The members have taken an  oath to defend this new Constitution. By  both action and words, all the members of this Court have made it plain beyond  any shadow of doubt that the new Constitution is legally and factually in  force. The justices of this Court would  be the last persons to interpret and enforce something they do not consider  valid, legitimate, and effective. It is  not alone the taking of an oath to support and defend the new constitution that  indicates clearly what the Court meant then it rendered the Javellana vs. Executive Secretary L-36142 decision. The meaning of the decision is quite the fact that the Court has been  enlarged beyond its earlier composition. It has reorganized itself into two divisions. Each division is now trying cases pursuant to  the New Constitution. All courts are  under the administrative supervision of the Supreme Court. An examination decisions rendered by the  Court since the Javellana vs. Executive  Secretary decision will show that there is constant reference to the 1973  Constitution. Its provisions form the  basis for its authority to interpret and expound on the laws. Whenever a provision of the Constitution is  invoked, the Court turns to the 1973 Constitution as the present  Constitution. I can see no clearer  interpretation of a decision of this Court than these various acts of the Court  itself. XVII A FEW OTHER POINTS There are a few other points which I would like to answer  briefly. Petitioner Francisco  ""Soc"" Rodrigo states that while he was released from detention on December 5, 1972 , his release is conditional and subject to some  restrictions. He is not allowed to leave  the confines of the Greater Manila area unless specifically authorized by the  military. He states that his petition  for habeas corpus is not moot and academic because of his release. Considering my opinion on the constitutionality of Proclamation  No. 1081, it follows that the release of petitioners Jose W. Diokno and Benigno S. Aquino may not  ordered. The petitions for their  release, as in the case of detainees already released, must be directed to the  President. * If such is the case with petitioners who are  actually detained and confined, with more reason should the principles herein  enunciated apply to those no longer confined or detained. In the case of former Senator Benigno S. Aquino , criminal charges have been filed against  him. As a rule a petition for the wr it of habeas corpus is satisfactorily  answered by a showing that a prisoner is detained on the basis of valid  criminal charges. However, petitioner Aquino challenges the jurisdiction of the military tribunal  and the validity of the charges against him. Therefore, insofar as all issues in the case of Benigno S. Aquino vs .  Military Commission No. 2. L-37364, which a re  common to the issues in these instant petition are concerned, this decision  applies. On any other issued not common  to the issues in these Petitions, I am reserving my opinion for L-37364. XVIII THE REMEDIES AGAINST CLEAR ABUSE OF POWER The general remedy against an arbitrary, whimsical, or capricious  exercise of the martial law power of the President, as it is the remedy on all  political questions, is the voice of the people in the election when one is  held, or through the Barangays which the President  himself has consulted in the July 27 and 28, 1973 referendum on whether the  people wanted President Marcos to continue beyond 1973 and finish the reforms  he has initiated under marcial law. The President has  officially announced a number of times that he would consult with the Barangays periodically. Under this remedy, the people, in the exercise of their sovereign power,  can base their decision, not only on whether the acts of the President has been  arbitrary, whimsical, or capricious; they can base their decision on a broader  basis — and that is whether, in their own opinion, the President acted  correctly or not. Or if and when the interim assembly is convened, a majority of  the members thereof, as representatives of the people, can also remedy an  arbitrary, whimsical, capricious, or even an unwise exercise of the power, by  so advising the Prime Minister to lift martial law under pain of being deposed  as Prime Minister. As we declare the proclamation and the continuation of martial  law political and therefore nonjusticiable in nature,  We are only acknowledging the constitutional limitation of that power to justiciable questions only, just as we had defined the constitutional limitations of the  powers of Congress and of the Executive. As the interpreter of the Constitution, the Court has to lead in  respecting its boundaries. Our jurisprudence is replete with examples where this Court  exercised its judicial power in appropriate cases ( Avelino vs . Cuenco , 83 Phil. 17; Araneta vs . Dinglasan 84 Phil. 386; Nationalista Party vs . Bautista, 85 Phil. 101;  Rodriguez vs . Gella , 92 Phil. 603; Rutter vs . Esteban, 93 Phil. 68; Aytona vs . Castillo, 4 SCRA 533, to name only the  few), which should more than prove that no matter how grave or urgent, delicate  or formidable and novel or uncommon a legal problem is, the Court will know  when and how to resolve it. Specifically, it will know what to do if, as  petitioners fear, a President may someday wake up and out of the blue proclaim  martial law. Of course, this is already  almost an impossibility under the parliamentary system established by the New  Constitution. XIX C O N C L U S I O N The voluminous pleadings and the lengthy arguments supporting the  petitions are generally couched in erudite and eloquent language. It is regrettable that they have been tainted  in a number of instances with frenzied and biting statements indicative a sense  of exasperation. I am certain, however,  that these statements cannot affect the high sense of impartiality of the  members of the Court as they giv e their opinion in these cases. The President is the highest elective official in the  country. It was no casual or perfunctory  choice which elevated him to the position. It is his duty, no less than that of this Court, to save the Republic  from the perils of rebellion and insurrection. In order to preserve public safety and good order, he has been forced to  proclaim a state of martial law. To  insure the continuation of civilian authority and democratic institutions, he  has utilized the armed forces to quell the armed challenge and to remedy the  ancient evils upon which rebellion and insurrection flourish. The petitioners dispute the President's determination and  question his motives. To them the  exercise of his constitutional powers is an abuse of executive powers and  assumption of a dictatorship. Inasmuch as the real reason for the imposition of  martial law, according to petitioner Diokno , is not  to preserve the nation but to keep the President in power, there is only one  decision the Court should make. It  should invalidate Proclamation No. 1081. The dire consequences are given by the petitioner-eventual resort to  arms, shedding of blood, destruction of property and irreparable loss of  invaluable lives — which, of course are the same consequences sought to be  avoided when martial law was proclaimed. The Supreme Court may be the highest court of the land. It is not, however, a super Being over and  above the Executive, the Legislature and the Constitution, deciding cases on an  infallible sense of Truth and a faculty of divination. Principles of liberty, right, and justice are  not interpreted in an abstract and dogmatic form. They are applied in the manner the sovereign  people adopted our institutions of government and formulated our written  Constitution. The Supreme Court can rule on the proclamation of martial law  only insofar as its validity under the Constitution is raised as an issue. If the Constitution, the expression of  sovereign will, vests the determination of the necessity for martial law in the  President the Court shall so declare and respect it. However, the determination of the wisdom of the propriety of the  proclamation must rest with the people. Wisdom and propriety in the making of  supremely political decisions and in the exercise of political functions are  for the people to assess and determine. Under our constitutional form of  government, no official or department can effectively exercise a power unless  the people support it. Review by the  people may not be as clearcut and frequent as  judicial review but it is actual, present, and most effective. The constitutional  process and the rule of law are interpreted  and enforced by the Supreme Court but then viability and strength depend  on the support and faith of the people. Consequently, if our people allow the system of government to be changed, no pronouncement of this  Court can reverse the change or topple an alleged dictator from power. Only the people can do it. Fortunately, the trend of present events clearly shows that  martial law instead of destroying constitutional government as advanced by the  petitioners, is, in fact, saving and strengthening it. WHEREFORE , I vote to render judgment. (1) To grant the Diokno motion to withdraw his petition for habeas corpus, (2) Declaring that the decision proclaim martial  law is a political question and the Court may not examine the grounds upon which  Proclamation No. 1081 is based; granting that the Court may do so, there, is  sufficient constitutional factual basis for the same and certainly the  President has not acted arbitrarily, whimsically or capriciously in issuing the  Proclamation; that on both grounds, said Proclamation No. 1081 is  constitutional; (3) Declaring that the privilege of the writ of  habeas corpus is ipso facto suspended upon a proclamation of martial  law; and in effect, General Order. No. 2-A suspended said privilege; (4) Declaring that the continuation of the state  of martial law is similarly a political question and that it is for the  President or the Prime Minister, under the New Constitution, to determine when  it may be lifted; and granting that this Court may examine the factual basis  for the continuation of martial law, We find sufficient basis for the same; and (5) Dismissing the various petitions for the writ  of habeas corpus of petitioners still detained, or under ""community  arrest"" within the Greater Manila area, without cost. [1] General Order No. 2 reads as follows: ""Pursuant  to Proclamation No. 1081, dated September 21, 1972, and in my capacity as  Commander-in-Chief of all the Armed Forces of the Philippines and for being  active participants in the conspiracy to seize political and state power in the country and to take over the Government  by force, the extent of which has now assumed the proportion of an actual  war against our people and their  legitimate Government and in order to prevent them from further committing acts  that are inimical or injurious to our people, the Government and our national  interest, I hereby order you as Secretary of National Defense to  forthwith arrest or cause the arrest and take into custody the individuals  named in the attached list and to hold them until otherwise so ordered by me or  by my designated representative. ""Likewise, I do hereby circler you to  arrest or cause the arrest and take into custody and to hold them  until otherwise ordered released by me or my duly authorized representative,  such persons as may have committed in crimes and offenses in furtherance or on  the occasion of or incident to or in connection with the crimes of insurrection  or rebellion as well as persons who have committed crimes against national  security and the law of nations, crimes against the fundamental laws of the  state, crimes against public order, crimes involving  usurpation of authority; title improper use of name; uniform and insignia,  including persons guilty of crimes as public officers, as well as those  persons who may have violated any decree or promulgated by me  personally or promul gated upon my direction.” * On the issue or withdrawal, petitioner"" refers to former Senator Jose W. D iokno and not any of the  other petitioners. * Although this Rule 17 falls  under ""Procedure in Courts of First Instance"" it may also serve as a  guide to this Court in resolving a question of this nature. In the Court of Appeals, and in the Supreme  Court,"" An appeal may be withdrawn as of right at any time before filing  of appellee's brief. After that brief is filed the withdrawal may be allowed the Court in its discretion. "" (Section 4, Rule 50; Section 1, Rule 36) 1 “(2)""The President shall be  the commander-in-­chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and, whenever it  becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress  lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion. In case of invasion, insurrection, rebellion,  or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, he may suspend  the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus , or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law.""(Par 2, Sec. 10 Art. VII, 1935  Constitution). ""SEC. 12.  The Prime Minister shall be commander-in-chief of all armed forces of the  Philippines and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed  forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or  rebellion in case of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger  thereof, when the public safety requires it, he may suspend the privilege of  the writ of habeas corpus , or place the Philippines or any part thereof  under martial law."" (Sec. 12 Art. IX, New Constitution). It should be noted  that the above provision is a verbatim reiteration of Article VII, Section 10,  Paragraph (2) of the old Constitution. 1 Formed by the Constitutional  Convention to prepare the final draft of  the Constitution. I was a member  of this Committee, being the Vice- Chairman  of the Panel of Floorleaders . * I n fact Petition, Decision as ordered released by the Presidents on September 11, 1974 CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION FERNANDO, J. : The issue involved in these habeas corpus petitions is the  pre-eminent problem of the times — the primacy to be accorded the claims of  liberty during periods of crisis. There is  much that is novel in what confronts the Court. A traditional orientation may not suffice. The approach taken cannot be characterized by  rigidity and inflexibility. There is  room, plenty of it, for novelty and innovation. Doctrines deeply rooted in the past, that have stood the test of time  and circumstance, must be made adaptable to present needs and, hopefully,  serviceable to an unknown future, the events of which, to recall Story, are  locked up in the inscrutable designs of a merciful Providence .  It is essential then that in the consideration of the petitions before us there  be objectivity, calmness, and understanding. The deeper the disturbance in the atmosphere of security, the more  compelling is the need for tranquility of mind, if reason is to prevail. No legal barrier is to be interposed to  thwart the efforts of the Executive to restore normalcy. He is not to be denied the power to take what  for him may be necessary measures to meet emergency conditions. So the  realities of the situation dictate. There should be on the part of the judiciary then, sensitivity to the  social forces at work; creating conditions of grave unrest and turbulence and  threatening the very stability, not to say existence, of the political  order. It is in that setting that the  crucial, issue posed by these petitions is to be appraised. It may be that this clash between the primacy  of liberty and the legitimate defense of authority is not susceptible of any  definite, clearcut solution. Nonetheless; an attempt has to be made. With  all due recognition of the merit apparent in the exhaustive, scholarly and  eloquent dissertations of Justice Barredo and my  other brethren as well as the ease and lucidity with which the Chief Justice  clarified the complex issues and the views of members of the Court, I would  like to give a brief expression to my thoughts to render clear the points on  which I find myself, with regret, unable to be of the same persuasion. I concur in the dismissal of the habeas corpus petition of Benigno S. Aquino , Jr. solely on  the ground that charges had been filed, and dissent in part in the dismissal of  the petition of Francisco Rodrigo and others, * who joined him in his plea for the removal of the conditions on their release,  on the view that as far as freedom of travel is concerned, it should be, on  principle, left unrestricted. As  originally prepared, this opinion likewise explained his dissent in the denial  of the motion to withdraw in the petition filed on behalf of Jose W. Diokno , a matter now moot and academic. 1. We have to pass on habeas corpus petitions. The great writ of  liberty is involved. Rightfully, it is  latitudinarian in scope. It is  wide-ranging and all-embracing in its reach. It can dig deep into the facts to assure that there be no toleration of  illegal restraint. Detention must be for  a cause recognized by law. The writ  imposes on the judiciary the grave responsibility of ascertaining whether a  deprivation of physical freedom is warranted. The party who is keeping a person in custody has to produce him in court  as soon as possible. What is more, he  must justify the action taken. Only if  it can be demonstrated that there has been no violation of one's right to  liberty will he be absolved from responsibility. Failing that, the confinement  must thereby cease. Nor does it suffice  that there be a court process, order, or decision on which it is made to  rest. If there be a showing of a  violation of constitutional rights, the jurisdiction of the tribunal issuing it  is ousted. Moreover, even if there be a  valid sentence, it cannot, even for a moment, be extended beyond the period  provided for by law. When that time  comes, he is entitled to be released. It  is in that sense then, as so well put by Holmes, that this great writ ""is  the usual remedy for unlawful imprisonment."" [1] It does afford, to borrow from the language of Birkenhead ,  ""a swift and imperative remedy in all cases of illegal restraint or  confinement."" [2] Not that there is need for actual incarceration. A custody for which there is no support in  law suffices for its invocation. The party proceeded against is usually a  public official, the run-of-the-mill petitions often coming from individuals  who for one reason or another have run afoul of the penal laws. Confinement  could likewise come about because of contempt citations, [3] whether from the judiciary or from the legislature. It could also be due to statutory commands,  whether addressed to cultural minorities [4] or to persons diseased. [5] Then, too, this proceeding could be availed of by citizens subjected to  military discipline [6] as well as aliens seeking entry into or to be deported from the country. [7] Even those outside the government service may be made to account for their  action as in the case of wives restrained by their husbands or children  withheld from the proper parent or guardian. [8] It is thus apparent that any deviation from the legal norms calls for the  restoration of freedom. It cannot be  otherwise. It would be sheer mockery of  all that such a legal order stands for, if any person's right to live and work  where he is minded to move about freely, and to be rid of any unwarranted fears  that he would just be picked up and detained, is not accorded full  respect. The significance of the writ  then for a regime of liberty cannot be overemphasized. 2. Nor does the fact that, at the time of the filing of these  petitions martial law had been declared, call for a different conclusion. There is of course imparted to the matter a  higher degree of complexity. For it  cannot be gainsaid that the reasonable assumption is that the President  exercised such an awesome power one granted admittedly to cope with an  emergency or crisis situation, because in his judgment the situation as thus  revealed to him left him with no choice. What the President did attested to an executive determination of the  existence of the conditions that called for such a move. There was, in his opinion, an insurrection or  rebellion of such magnitude that public safety did require placing the country  under martial law. That decision was his  to make; it is not for the judiciary. The assessment thus made, for all the sympathetic consideration it is  entitled to, is not, however, impressed with finality. This Court has a limited sphere of  authority. That, for me, is the teaching  of Lansang. 10 The judicial role is difficult, but it is unavoidable. The writ of liberty has been invoked by  petitioners. They must be heard, and we  must rule on their petitions. 3. This Court has to act then. The liberty enshrined in the Constitution, for the protection of which  habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy, imposes that obligation. Its task is clear. It must be performed. That is a trust to which it cannot be  recreant. Whenever the grievance  complained of is deprivation of liberty, it is its responsibility to inquire  into the matter and to render the decision appropriate under the  circumstances. Precisely, a habeas  corpus petition calls for that response. For the significance of liberty in a constitutional regime cannot be  sufficiently stressed. Witness these  words from the then Justice, later Chief Justice, Concepcion : ""Furthermore, individual freedom is too  basic, too transcendental and vital in a republican state, like ours, to be  denied upon mere general principles and abstract consideration of public  safety. Indeed, the preservation of  liberty is such a major preoccupation of our political system that, not  satisfied with guaranteeing its enjoyment in the very first paragraph of section  (1) of the Bill of Rights, the framers of our Constitution devoted [twelve  other] paragraphs [thereof] to the protection of several aspects of  freedom."" 11 A similar sentiment was given expression by the then Justice, later Chief  Justice, Bengzon : ""Let the rebels have no reason to apprehend that their comrades now  under custody are being railroaded into Muntinlupa without benefit of those fundamental privileges which the experience of the  ages has deemed essential for the protection of all persons accused of crime  before the tribunals of justice. Give  them the assurance that the judiciary, ever mindful of its sacred mission will  not, thru faulty cogitation or misplaced devotion, uphold any doubtful claims  of Governmental power in diminution of individual rights, but will always cling  to the principle uttered long ago by Chief Justice Marshall that when in doubt  as to the construction of the Constitution, 'the Courts will favor personal  liberty' . . ."" 12 The pertinence of the above  excerpt becomes quite manifest when it is recalled that its utterance was in  connection with a certiorari proceeding where the precise point at issue  was whether or not the right to bail could be availed of when the privilege of  the writ of habeas corpus was suspended. There was no decisive outcome, although there were five votes in favor  of an affirmative answer to only four against. 13 Such pronouncements in cases  arising under the 1935 Constitution should occasion no surprise. They merely  underscore what was so vigorously emphasized by the then Delegate. Jose P. Laurel,  Chairman of the Committee on the Bill of Rights, in his sponsorship address of  the draft provisions. Thus: ""The history of the world is the history  of man and his arduous struggle for liberty. ... It is the history of those  brave and able souls who, in the ages that are past, have labored, fought and  bled that the government of the lash — that symbol of slavery and despotism —  might endure no more. It is the history  of those great self-sacrificing men who lived and suffered in an age of  cruelty, pain and desolation so that every man might stand, under the  protection of great rights and privileges, the equal of every other man."" 14 So should it be under the present Constitution. No less a person than President Marcos during the early months of the  1971 Constitutional Convention categorically affirmed in his Today's  Revolution: Democracy : ""Without freedom, the whole concept of  democracy falls apart."" 15 Such a View has support in  history. A statement from Dr. Rizal has a contemporary ring: ""Give liberties, so that no one may have  a right to conspire."" 16 Mabini listed as an accomplishment of the ill-fated revolution against the Americans  the manifestation of ""our love of freedom guaranteeing to each citizen the  exercise of certain rights which make our communal life less constricted . .  ."" 17 4. Equally so, the decisive issue is one of liberty not only  because of the nature of the petitions, but also because that is the mandate of  the Constitution. That is its  philosophy. It is a regime of liberty to  which our people are so deeply and firmly committed. 18 The fate of the individual petitioners hangs in the balance. That is of great  concern. What is at stake, however, is  more than that — much more. There is a paramount public interest involved. The  momentous question is how far in times of stress fidelity can be manifested to  the claims of liberty. So it is ordained  by the Constitution, and it is the highest law. It must be obeyed. Nor does it make a crucial difference, to my mind,  that martial law exists. It may call for  a more cautious approach. The simplicity of constitutional fundamentalism may  not suffice for the complex problems of the day. Still, the duty remains to assure that the  supremacy of the Constitution is upheld. Whether in good times or bad, it must be accorded the utmost respect and  deference. That is what  constitutionalism connotes. It is, its  distinctive characteristic. Greater  restraints may, of course, be imposed. Detention, to cite the obvious example, is not ruled out under martial  law, but even the very proclamation thereof is dependent on public safety'  making it imperative. The powers, rather  expansive, perhaps at times even latitudinarian, allowable the administration  under its aegis, with the consequent diminution of the sphere of liberty, are  justified only under the assumption that thereby the beleaguered state is in a  better position to protect, defend and preserve itself. They are hardly  impressed with the element of permanence. They cannot endure longer than the emergency that called for the  executive having to make use of this extraordinary prerogative. When it is a thing of the past, martial law  must be at an end. It has no more reason  for being. If its proclamation is open  to objection or its continuance no longer warranted, there is all the more  reason, to follow Laski , to respect the traditional  limitation of legal authority that freedom demands. 19 With these habeas corpus petitions precisely rendering peremptory action by  this Court, there is the opportunity for the assessment of liberty considered  in a concrete social context. With full appreciation then of the complexities  of this era of turmoil and disquiet, it can hopefully contribute to the  delineation of constitutional boundaries. It may even be able to demonstrate that law can be timeless and yet  timely. 5. There arc relevant questions that still remain to be  answered. Does not the proclamation of  martial law carry with it the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus? If so, should not the principle  above enunciated be subjected to further refinement? I am not too certain that the first query  necessarily calls for an affirmative answer. Preventive detention is of course allowable. Individuals who are linked with invasion or  rebellion may pose a danger to the public safety. There is nothing inherently unreasonable in  their being confined. Moreover, where it is the President himself, as in the  case of these petitioners, who personally 'directed that they be taken in, it  is not easy to impute arbitrariness. It  may happen though that officers 'of lesser stature not impressed with the high  sense of responsibility would utilize the situation to cause the apprehension  of persons without sufficient justification. Certainly it would be, to my mind,  to sanction oppressive acts if the validity of such detention cannot be  inquired into through habeas corpus petitions. It is more than just desirable therefore that if such be the intent,  there be a specific decree concerning the suspension of the privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus. Even then,  however, such proclamation could be challenged. If vitiated by constitutional infirmity, the release may be ordered. Even if it were otherwise, the applicant may  not be among those as to whom the privilege of the writ has been  suspended. It is pertinent to note in  this connection that Proclamation No. 1081 specifically states ""that all  persons presently detained, as well as all others who may hereafter be similarly  detained for the crimes of insurrection or rebellion, and all other crimes and  offenses committed in furtherance or on the occasion thereof, or incident  thereto, or in connection therewith, for crimes against national security and  the law of nations, crimes against the fundamental laws of the State, crimes  against public order, crimes involving usurpation of authority, rank, title and  improper use of names, uniforms and insignia, crimes committed by public  officers, and for such other crimes as will be enumerated in Orders that I  shall subsequently promulgate, as well as crimes as a consequence of any violation of any decree,  order or regulation promulgated by me personally or promulgated upon my  direction shall be kept under detention until otherwise ordered released by me  or by my duly designated representative."" 20 The implication appears to be that  unless the individual detained is included among those to whom any of the above  crimes or offenses may be imputed, he is entitled to judicial protection.  Lastly, the question of whether or not there is warrant for the view that  martial law is at an end may be deemed proper not only in the light of  radically altered conditions but also because of certain executive acts clearly  incompatible with its continued existence. Under such circumstances, an element of a justiciable controversy may be discerned. 6. That brings me to the political question doctrine. Its accepted signification is that where the  matter involved is left to a decision by the people acting in their sovereign  capacity or to the sole determination by either or both the legislative or  executive branches of the government, it is beyond judicial cognizance. 21 Thus it was that in suits where the party proceeded against was either the  President or Congress, or any of its branches for that matter, the courts  refused to act. 22 Unless such be the case, the action taken by any or both the political branches  whether in the form of a legislative act or an executive order could be tested  in court. Where private rights are  affected, the judiciary has the duty to look into its validity. There is this further implication of the  doctrine A showing that plenary power is granted either department of  government may not be an obstacle to judicial inquiry. Its improvident exercise or the abuse thereof  may give rise to a justiciable controversy. 23 What is more, a constitutional grant of authority is not usually unrestricted. 24 Limitations are provided for as to what may be done and how it is to be  accomplished. Necessarily then, it  becomes the responsibility of the courts to ascertain whether the two  coordinate branches have adhered to the mandate of the fundamental law. The question thus posed is judicial rather  than political. 7. Reference at this point to the epochal opinion in the aforecited Lansang vs . Garcia  decision, where the validity of the suspension of the privilege of the writ of  habeas corpus was sustained by this Court, is not amiss. For in both the 1935 and the present  Constitutions, the power to declare martial law is embraced in the same provision  with the grant of authority to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas  corpus, with the same limits to be observed in the exercise thereof. 25 It would follow, therefore, that a similar approach commends itself on the  question of whether or not the finding made by the President in Proclamation  No. 1081 as to the existence of ""rebellion and armed action undertaken by  these lawless elements of the communist and other armed aggrupations organized to overthrow the Republic of the Philippines by armed violence and  force [impressed with the] magnitude of an actual state of war against [the]  people and the Republic."" 26 is open to judicial inquiry.  Reference to the opinion of Chief Justice Concepcion would prove illuminating: ""Indeed,  the grant of power to suspend the privilege is neither absolute nor  unqualified. The authority conferred by  the Constitution, both under the Bill of Rights and under the Executive  Department, is limited and conditional. The precept in the Bill of Rights establishes a general rule, as well as  an exception thereto. What is more, it postulates the former in the negative,  evidently to stress its importance, by providing that '(t)he privilege of the  writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended....' It is only by way of  exception that it permits the suspension of the privilege 'in cases of  invasion, insurrection, or rebellion' -- or, under Art. VII of the  Constitution, 'imminent danger thereof' — 'when the public safety requires it,  in any of which events the same may be suspended wherever during such period  the necessity for such suspension shall exist.' Far from being full and plenary, the authority to suspend the privilege  of the writ is thus circumscribed, confined and restricted not only by the  prescribed setting or the conditions essential to its existence, but also as  regards the time when and the place where it may be exercised. These factors and the aforementioned setting  or conditions mark, establish and define the extent, the confines and the  limits of said power, beyond which it does not exist. And, like the limitations and restrictions  imposed by the Fundamental Law upon the legislative department, adherence  thereto and compliance therewith may, within proper bounds, be inquired into by  courts of justice. Otherwise, the  explicit constitutional provisions thereon would be meaningless. Surely, the  framers of our Constitution could not have intended to engage in such a  wasteful exercise in futility."" 27 Such a view was fortified by the  high estate accorded individual freedom as made clear in the succeeding  paragraph of his opinion: ""Much  less may the assumption be indulged in when we bear in mind that our political  system is essentially democratic and republican in character and that the  suspension of the privilege affects the most fundamental element of that  system, namely, individual freedom. Indeed, such freedom includes and connotes, as well as demands, the  right of every single member of our citizenry to freely discuss and dissent  from, as well as criticize and denounce, the views, the policies and the  practices of the government and the party in power that he deems unwise,  improper or inimical to the commonwealth, regardless of whether his own opinion  is objectively correct or not. The untrammeled  enjoyment and exercise of such right — which; under certain conditions, may be  a civic duty of the highest order — is vital to the democratic system and  essential to its successful operation and wholesome growth and  development."" 28 The writer wrote a concurring and dissenting opinion. He was fully in agreement with the rest of  his brethren as to the lack of conclusiveness attached to the presidential  determination. Thus: ""The doctrine announced in Montenegro vs . Castaneda that such a question is political has thus been laid to  rest. It is about time too. It owed its existence to the compulsion  exerted by Barcelon vs . Baker, a 1905  decision. This Court was partly misled  by an undue reliance in the latter case on what it considered to be  authoritative pronouncements from such illustrious American jurists as  Marshall, Story, and Taney. That is to  misread what was said by them. This is  most evident in the case of Chief Justice Marshall, whose epochal Marbury vs . Madison was cited. Why that was so is difficult to understand. For it speaks to the contrary. It was by virtue of this decision that the  function of judicial review owes its origin notwithstanding the absence of any  explicit provision in the American Constitution empowering the courts to do  so. Thus: 'It is emphatically the province and duty of  the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound  and interpret that rule. If two laws  conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each. So  if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the  constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide  that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably  to the constitution, disregarding, the law; the court must determine which of  these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty. If, then; the courts are to regard the  constitution, and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of  legislature, the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case  to which they, both apply."" 29 8. To refer to Lansang anew, this Court  sustained the presidential proclamation suspending the privilege of the writ of  habeas corpus as there was no showing of arbitrariness in the exercise of a  prerogative belonging to the executive, the judiciary merely acting as a check  on the exercise of such authority. So  Chief Justice Concepcion made clear in this portion  of his opinion: ""Article VII of the  Constitution vests in the Executive power to suspend the privilege of the writ  of habeas corpus under specified conditions. Pursuant to the principle of separation of  powers underlying our system of government, the Executive is supreme within his  own sphere. However, the separation of powers, under the Constitution, is not  absolute. What is more, it goes hand in hand with the system of checks and  balances, under which the Executive is supreme, as regards the suspension of  the privilege, but only if and when he acts within the sphere allotted to him  by the Basic Law, and the authority to determine whether or not he has so acted  is vested in the Judicial Department, which, in this respect, is, in turn,  constitutionally supreme. In the  exercise of such authority, the function of the Court is merely to check not  to supplant — the Executive, or to ascertain merely whether he has gone  beyond the constitutional limits of his jurisdiction, not to exercise the  power vested in him or to determine the wisdom of his act. To be sure, the power of the Court to  determine the validity of the contested proclamation is far from being  identical to, or even comparable with, its power over ordinary civil or  criminal cases elevated thereto by ordinary appeal from inferior courts, in  which cases the appellate court has all of the powers of the court of  origin."" 30 The test then to determine whether the presidential action should be nullified  according to the Supreme Court is that of arbitrariness. Absent such a showing, there is no  justification for annulling the presidential proclamation. On this point, the writer, in a separate opinion, had this to  say: ""With such presidential  determination of the existence of the conditions required by the Constitution  to justify a suspension of the privilege of the writ no longer conclusive on  the other branches, this Court may thus legitimately inquire into its  validity. The question before us, it  bears repeating, is whether or not Proclamation No. 889 as it now stands, not  as it was originally issued, is valid. The starting point must be a recognition that the power to suspend the  privilege of the writ belongs to the Executive, subject to limitations. So the  Constitution provides, and it is to be respected. The range of permissible inquiry  to be conducted by this Tribunal is necessarily limited then to the  ascertainment of whether or not such a suspension, in the light of the credible  information furnished the President, was arbitrary. Such a test met with the approval of the  chief counsel for petitioners, Senator Jose W. Diokno . To paraphrase Frankfurter, the question  before the judiciary is not the correctness but the reasonableness of the  action taken. One who is not the  Executive but equally knowledgeable may entertain a different view, but the  decision rests with the occupant of the office. As would be immediately apparent even from a cursory perusal of the data  furnished the President, so impressively summarized in the opinion of the Chief  Justice, the imputation of arbitrariness would be difficult to sustain. Moreover, the steps taken by him to limit the  area where the suspension operates as well as his instructions attested to a  firm resolve on his part to keep strictly within the bounds of his  authority. Under the circumstances, the  decision reached by the Court that no finding of unconstitutionality is  warranted commends itself for approval. The most that can be said is that there was a manifestation of  presidential power well-nigh touching the extreme borders of his conceded  competence, beyond which a forbidden domain lies. The requisite showing of  either improvidence or abuse has not been made."" 31 9. The Lansang doctrine for me is  decisive on the various issues raised in this case, my discussion being  confined to petitioner Rodrigo, as well as others similarly situated, for under  my view that the petition in Aquino should be  dismissed because charges had been filed, and the petition in Diokno should be considered withdrawn, there need be no  further inquiry as to the merits of their respective contentions. Now, first as to the validity of the proclamation itself. It would seem that it is beyond question in  the light of this particular transitory provision in the present  Constitution: ""All proclamations,  orders, decrees, instructions, and acts promulgated, issued, or done by the  incumbent President shall be part of the law of the land, and shall remain  valid, legal, binding, and effective even after lifting of martial law or the  ratification of this Constitution, unless modified, revoked, or superseded by  subsequent proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions, or other acts of the  incumbent President, or unless expressly and explicitly modified or repealed by  the regular National Assembly."" 32 Independently of such provision,  such presidential proclamation could not be characterized as arbitrary under  the standard set forth in the Lansang decision. He did act ""on the basis of carefully  evaluated and verified information, [which] definitely established that lawless  elements who are moved by a common or similar ideological conviction, design  strategy and goal and enjoying the active moral and material support of a  foreign power and being guided and directed by intensely devoted, well-trained,  determined and ruthless groups of men and seeking refuge under the protection  of our constitutional liberties to promote and attain their ends, have entered  into a conspiracy and have in fact joined and banded their resources and forces  together for the prime purpose of, and in fact they have been and are actually  staging, undertaking and waging an armed insurrection and rebellion against the  Government of the Republic of the Philippines in order to forcibly seize  political and state power in the country, overthrow the duly constituted  government and supplant our existing political, social, economic and legal  order with an entirely new one whose form of government, whose system of laws,  whose conception of God and religion, whose notion of individual rights and  family relations, and whose political, social, economic legal and moral  precepts are based on the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist teachings and beliefs; . .  ."" 33 Subsequent events did confirm the validity of such  appraisal. Even now, from the pleadings  of the Solicitor General, the assumption that the situation has not in certain  places radically changed for the better cannot be stigmatized as devoid of  factual foundation. As of the present then, even on the view that the courts  may declare that the crisis conditions have ended and public safety does not  require the continuance of martial law, there is not enough evidence to warrant  such a judicial declaration. This is not  to deny that in an appropriate case with the proper parties, and, in the  language of Justice Laurel, with such issue being the very lis mota , they may be compelled to assume such an  awesome responsibility. A sense of  realism as well as sound juristic theory would place such delicate task on the  shoulders of this Tribunal, the only constitutional court. So I would read Rutter vs . Esteban. 34 There, while the Moratorium Act 35 was at first assumed to be valid, with this Court in such suit being persuaded  that its ""continued operation and enforcement"" under circumstances  that developed later, became ""unreasonable and oppressive,"" and  should not be prolonged a minute longer, ... [it was] ""declared null and  void and without effect."" 36 It goes without saying that before  it should take such a step, extreme care should be taken lest, the maintenance  of public peace and order, the primary duty of the Executive, be attended with  extreme difficulty. It is likewise  essential that the evidence of public safety no longer requiring martial law be  of the clearest and most satisfactory character. It cannot be too strongly stressed that while  liberty is a prime objective and the judiciary is charged with the duty of  safeguarding it, on a matter of such gravity during periods of emergency, the  executive appraisal of the situation is deserving of the utmost credence. It suffices to recall the stress laid by  Chief Justice Concepcion in Lansang that its function ""is merely to check — not to supplant ""  the latter. The allocation of authority  in the Constitution made by the people themselves to the three departments of  government must be respected. There is  to be no intrusion by any one into the sphere that belongs to another. Precisely because of such fundamental  postulate in those cases, and there may be such, but perhaps rather rare, it  could amount to judicial abdication if no inquiry were deemed permissible and  the question considered political. The last point is, while the detention of petitioners could have  been validly ordered, as dictated by the very proclamation itself, if it  continued for an unreasonable length of time, then his release may be sought in  a habeas corpus proceeding. This  contention is not devoid of plausibility. Even in times of stress, it cannot just be assumed that the indefinite  restraint of certain individuals as a preventive measure is unavoidable. It is not to be denied that where such a  state of affairs could be traced to the wishes of the President himself it  carries with it the presumption of validity. The test is again arbitrariness as defined in Lansang . It may happen that the continued confinement  may be at the instance merely of a military official, in which case there is  more leeway for judicial scrutiny. 10. A word more on the withdrawal of a habeas corpus petition. On the basic assumption that precisely the  great writ of liberty is available to a person subjected to restraint so that  he could challenge its validity, I find it difficult not to yield assent to a  plea by the applicant himself that he is no longer desirous' of pursuing such  remedy. He had a choice of whether or  not to go to court. He was free to act  either way. The fact that at first he did so, but that later he was of a  different mind, does not, in my opinion, alter the situation. The matter for me, is still one left to his  free and unfettered will. The conclusion then, for me at least, is that a court  must accede to his wishes. It could  likewise be based on his belief that the realities of the situation compel the  conclusion that relief could come from the Executive. That decision was his to make. It must be respected. Moreover, if only because of humanitarian  considerations, considering the ill-effects of confinement on his state of  health, there is equally legal support for the view that his conditional  release as in the case of the other detainees would not be inappropriate. If his motion for withdrawal contained phraseology that is  offensive to the dignity of the court, then perhaps the corresponding  disciplinary action may be taken. For  that purpose, and for that purpose alone, the petition may be considered as  still within judicial cognizance. It is  true in certain cases that the issues raised may be so transcendental that  there is wisdom in continuing the proceeding. The withdrawal, even then, for me, is not fraught with pernicious  consequences. If the matter were that  significant or important, the probability is that the question will soon be  ventilated in another petition. There  is, to deal briefly with another point, the matter of the rather harsh and  bitter language in which the motion for withdrawal was couched. That is a matter of taste. Even if it went beyond the bounds of the  permissible, the withdrawal should be granted. This for me is the principle that should obtain. The rather uncharitable view expressed  concerning the ability of certain members of the Court to act justly on the  matter should not give rise, in my opinion, to undue concern. That is one's belief, and one is entitled to  it. It does not follow that thereby the  person thus unjustifiably maligned should suffer any loss of self-esteem. After all, it is a truism to say that a man  on the bench accountable only to his conscience and, in the ultimate analysis,  to his Maker. There is all the more  reason then not to be unduly bothered by the remarks in question. Moreover,  they emanated from a source suffering from the pangs of desperation born of his  continued detention. It could very well  be that the disappointment of expectations and frustration of hopes did lead to  such an intemperate outburst. There is,  for me at least, relevance to this excerpt from an opinion by Justice  Frankfurter: ""Since courts,  although representing the law, ... are also sitting in judgment, as it were, on  their own function in exercising their power to punish for contempt, it should  be used only in flagrant cases and with the utmost forbearance. It is always better to err on the side of  tolerance and even of disdainful indifference."" 37 11. There is novelty in the question raised by petitioner  Rodrigo. Nor is that the only reason why  it matters. It is fraught with  significance not only for him but also for quite a number of others in a like  predicament. They belong to a group  released from confinement. They are no  longer detained. Ordinarily that should  suffice to preclude resort to the remedy of habeas corpus. Offhand, it may be plausibly asserted that  the need no longer exists. The prison  wall, to paraphrase Chafee, is no longer there; it has fallen down. What is there to penetrate? That is just the  point, petitioner Rodrigo complains. That is not really true or only true  partially. There are physical as well as intellectual restraints on his  freedom. His release is  conditional. There are things he cannot  say, places he cannot go. That is not  liberty in a meaningful sense. This  great writ then has not lost its significance for him, as well as for others  similarly situated. The way he developed  his argument calls to mind Cardozo's warning that in  a world of reality, a juridical concept may not always be pressed to the limit  of its logic. There are countervailing  considerations. The fact that he was  among those whose detention was ordered by the President is one of them. There  was then an executive determination on the highest level that the state of  affairs marked by rebellious activities did call for certain individuals being  confined as a preventive measure. Unless  there is a showing of the arbitrariness of such a move, the judiciary has to  respect the actuation. It must be  assumed that what was to be done with them thereafter must have been given some  attention. At one extreme, their  preventive detention could be terminated and their full freedom restored. At the other, it could be continued if  circumstances did so warrant. Here, there was a middle way chosen. Petitioner Rodrigo as well as several others  were released subject to conditions. It  cannot be dogmatically maintained that such a solution was an affront to  reason. Not only for the person locked  up, but perhaps even more so for his family, the end of the incarceration was  an eagerly awaited and highly welcome event. That is quite understandable. It  did justify petitioner's assertion that in so agreeing to the conditions  imposed, he was not acting of his own free will. Realistically, he had no  choice, or one minimal at most. Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that he was a recipient of what at the  very least was a clear manifestation of the Philippine brand of martial law  being impressed with a mild character. This being a habeas corpus petition, the appropriate question for  judicial inquiry is the validity of the limits set to the conditional release  of petitioner Rodrigo. The guiding  principle, is supplied by this ringing affirmation of Justice Malcolm: ""Any restraint which will preclude  freedom of action is sufficient."" 38 The implication for me is that  there may be instances of the propriety of the invocation of the writ even  without actual incarceration. This is  one of them. It is heartening that the  Court so views it. It is, to my mind,  regrettable though that there appears to be full acceptance of the power of the  military to impose restrictions on petitioner Rodrigo's physical liberty. There  is need, it would seem to me, for a more discriminating appraisal, especially  where it could be shown that the order to that effect proceeds from a source  lower than the President. The extremely  high respect justifiably accorded to the action taken by the highest official  of the land, who by himself is a separate and independent department, not to  mention the one constitutional official authorized to proclaim martial law, is  not indicated. There should be, of  course, no casual or unreasoned disregard for what the military may deem to be  the appropriate measure under the circumstances. This reflection, though, gives me pause. Petitioner Rodrigo and others similarly situated  were released. That step would not have  been taken if circumstances did not justify it. It seems then reasonable to assume that full, rather than restricted,  freedom was warranted. The matter may be  put forth more categorically, but I refrain from doing so. The reason is practical. To insist that it should be thus may curb  what appears to be the commendable tendency to put an end to the preventive  detention of those in actual confinement. As for restraints on intellectual liberty embraced in freedom of speech  and of press, of assembly, and of association, deference to controlling  authorities compels me to say that the writ of habeas corpus is not the proper  case for assailing them. It does not  mean that judicial inquiry is foreclosed. Far from it. All that is intended  to be conveyed is that this remedy does not lend itself to that purpose. In so advocating this approach, I am not  unmindful that it might be looked upon as lack of awareness for the mischief  that may be caused by irresponsible elements, not to say the rebels  themselves. The words of Willoughby ,  whose view on martial law is the most sympathetic to the primacy of liberty,  furnish the antidote: ""As long as  the emergency lasts then, they must upon pain of arrest and subsequent punishment  refrain from committing acts that will render more difficult the restoration of  a state of normalcy and the enforcement of law."" 39 12. Reliance, as is quite evident from the foregoing, is well-nigh  solely placed on Philippine authorities. While the persuasive character of American Constitutional law doctrines  is not entirely a thing of the past, still, the novelty of the question before  us, compels in my view deference to the trend indicated by our past decisions,  read in the light not only of specific holdings but also of the broader  principles on which they are based. Even  if they do not precisely control, they do furnish a guide. Moreover, there seems to be a dearth of  United States Supreme Court pronouncements on the subject of martial law, due  no doubt to absence in the American Constitution of any provision concerning  it. It is understandable why no reference was made to such subject in  the earliest classic on American constitutional law written by Justice Story. 40 When the landmark 1866 Milligan case 41 made its appearance, and much more  so after Sterling 42 followed in 1932 and Duncan 43 in 1946, a discussion thereof became unavoidable. So it is evident from subsequent commentaries  and case books. 44 Cooley though, in his equally famous work that was first published in 1868  contented himself with footnote references to Milligan. 45 Watson viewed it in connection with the suspension of the privilege of the writ  of habeas corpus. 46 In the nineteen twenties, there  was a fuller treatment of the question of martial law. Burdick anticipated Willoughby with this appraisal: ""So-called  martial law, except in occupied territory of an enemy; is merely the calling in  of the aid of military forces by the executive, who is charged with the  enforcement of the law, with or without special authorization by the  legislature. Such declaration of martial  law does not suspend the civil law, though it may interfere with the exercise  of one's ordinary rights. The right to  call out the military forces to maintain order and enforce the law is simply  part of the police power. It is only  justified when it reasonably appears necessary, and only justifies such acts as  reasonably appear necessary to meet the exigency, including the arrest, or in  extreme cases the killing of those who create the disorder or oppose the  authorities. When the exigency is over  the members of the military forces are criminally and civilly liable for acts  done beyond the scope of reasonable necessity. When honestly and reasonably  coping with a situation of insurrection or riot a member of the military forces  cannot be made liable for his acts, and persons reasonably arrested under such  circumstances will not, during the insurrection or riot, be free by writ of  habeas corpus."" 47 Willoughby , as already  noted, was partial to the claims of liberty. This is quite evident in this excerpt in his opus: ""There is, then, strictly speaking, no  such thing in American law as a declaration of martial law whereby military law  is substituted for civil law. So-called  declarations of martial law are, indeed, often made, but their legal effect  goes no further than to warn citizens that the military powers have been called  upon by the executive to assist him in the maintenance of law and order, and  that, while the emergency lasts, they must, upon pain of arrest and punishment,  not commit any acts which will in any way render more difficult the restoration  of order and the enforcement of law. Some of the authorities stating substantially this doctrine are quoted  in the footnote below."" 48 Willis spoke similarly: ""Martial law proper, that is, military  law in case of insurrection, riots, and invasions, is not a substitute for the  civil law, but is rather an aid to the execution of civil law. Declarations of martial law go no further  than to warn citizens that the executive has called upon the military power to  assist him in the maintenance of law and order. While martial law is in force, no new powers are given to the executive  and no civil rights of the individual, other than the writ of habeas corpus,  are suspended. The relations between the  citizen and his state are unchanged."" 49 It is readily evident that even when Milligan supplied the only  authoritative doctrine, Burdick and Willoughby did not ignore the primacy of civil liberties. Willis wrote after Sterling . It would indeed be surprising if his opinion  were otherwise. After Duncan, such an  approach becomes even more, strongly fortified, Schwartz, whose treatise is the  latest to be published, has this summary of what he considers the present,  state of American law: ""The Milligan and Duncan cases show plainly that martial law is the public law  of necessity. Necessity alone, calls it  forth; necessity justifies its exercise; and necessity measures the extent and  degree to which it may be employed. It  is, the high Court has affirmed, an unbending rule of law that the exercise of  military power, where the rights of the citizen are concerned, may never be  pushed beyond what the exigency requires. If martial rule survives the necessity on which alone it rests, for even  a single minute, it becomes a mere exercise of lawless violence ."" 50 Further: "" Sterling vs. Constantin is of basic importance. Before it, a number of decisions, including  one by the highest Court, went on the theory that the executive had a free hand  in taking martial-law measures. Under  them, it had been widely supposed that a martial-law proclamation was so far  conclusive that any action taken under it was immune from judicial  scrutiny. Sterling vs. Constantin definitely discredits these earlier  decisions and the doctrine of conclusiveness derived from them. Under Sterling vs. Constantin ,  where martial law measures impinge upon personal or property rights — normally  beyond the scope of military power, whose intervention is lawful only because  an abnormal situation has made it necessary — the executive's ipse dixit is not of itself conclusive of the  necessity."" 51 It is not to be lost sight of that the basis for the declaration  of martial law in the Philippines is not mere necessity but an explicit constitutional provision. On the other hand, Milligan, which furnished  the foundation for Sterling 52 and Duncan 53 had its roots in the English common law. There is pertinence therefore in ascertaining its significance under  that system. According to the noted English author, Dicey: “ ‘Martial law,’ in the proper sense of that  term, in which it means the suspension of ordinary law and the temporary  government of a country or parts of it by military tribunals, is unknown to the  law of England. We have nothing  equivalent to what is called in France the 'Declaration of the State of Siege ,'  under which the authority ordinarily vested in the civil power for the  maintenance of order and police passes entirely to the army ( autorite militaire ). This is an unmistakable proof of the  permanent supremacy of the law under our constitution."" 54 There was this qualification: ""Martial law is sometimes employed as a name for the common law  right of the Crown and its servants to repel force by force in the case of  invasion, insurrection, riot, or generally of any violent resistance to the  law. This right, or power, is essential  to the very existence of orderly government, and is most assuredly recognized  in the most ample manner by the law of England . It is a power which has in itself no special  connection with the existence of an armed force. The Crown has the right to put down breaches  of the peace. Every subject, whether a  civilian or a soldier, whether what is called a 'servant of the government,'  such for example as a policeman, or a person in no way connected with the  administration, not only has the right, but is, as a matter of legal duty,  bound to assist in putting down breaches of the peace. No doubt policemen or soldiers are the  persons, who, as being specially employed in the maintenance of order, are most  generally called upon to suppress a riot, but it is clear that all loyal  subjects are bound to take their part in the suppression of riots."" 55 The picture would be incomplete, of course, if no reference were  made to Rossiter . In his work on Constitutional Dictatorship, where he discussed crisis  governments in the French Republic ,  in Great Britain and in the United States ,  he spoke of martial rule. For him, it  ""is an emergency device designed for use in the crises of invasion or  rebellion. It may be most precisely  defined as an extension of military government to the civilian population, the  substitution of the will of a military commander for the will of the people's  elected government. In the event of an  actual or imminent invasion by a hostile power, a constitutional government may  declare martial rule in the menaced area. The result is the transfer of all effective powers of government from  the civil authorities to the military, or often merely the assumption of such  powers by the latter when the regular government has ceased to function. In the event of a rebellion its initiation  amounts to a governmental declaration of war on those citizens in insurrection  against the state. In either case it  means military dictatorship — government by the army, courts-martial,  suspension of civil liberties, and the whole range of dictatorial action of an  executive nature. In the modern  democracies the military exercises such dictatorship while remaining  subordinate and responsible to the executive head of the civil government. Martial rule has a variety of forms and  pseudonyms, the most important of which are martial law , as it is known  in the common law countries of the British Empire and  the United States ,  and the state of seige , as it is known in the  civil law countries of continental Europe and Latin   America . The state of siege  and martial law are two edges to the same sword, and in action they can hardly  be distinguished. The institution of  martial rule is a recognition that there are times in the lives of all  communities when crisis has so completely disrupted the normal workings of  government that the military is the only power remaining that can restore  public order and secure the execution of the laws."" 56 Happily for the Philippines ,  the declaration of martial law lends itself to the interpretation that the  Burdick, Willoughby , Willis,  Schwartz formulations paying due regard to the primacy of liberty possess  relevance. It cannot be said that the  martial rule concept of Rossiter , latitudinarian in  scope, has been adopted, even on the assumption that it can be reconciled with  our Constitution. What is undeniable is  that President Marcos has repeatedly maintained that Proclamation No. 1081 was  precisely based on the Constitution and that the validity of acts taken thereunder could be passed upon by the Supreme Court. For me, that is quite reassuring, persuaded  as I am likewise that the view of Rossiter is opposed  to the fundamental concept of our polity, which puts a premium on freedom. No undue concern need then be felt as to the  continuing reliance on Moyer vs . Peabody, 57 where Justice Holmes speaking for  the Court, stated that the test of the validity of executive arrest is that  they be made ""in good faith and in the honest belief that they are 'needed  in order to head the insurrection off . . ."" 58 He did state likewise: ""When it  comes to a decision by the head of the state upon a matter involving its life,  the ordinary rights of individuals must yield to what he deems the necessities  of the moment. Public danger warrants  the substitution of executive process for judicial process. See Keely vs .  Sanders, 99 US 441, 446, 25 L ed. 327, 328. This was  admitted with regard to killing men in the actual clash of arms and we think it  obvious, although it was disputed, that the same is true of temporary detention  to prevent apprehended harm."" 59 Nor was this to manifest less than  full regard for civil liberties. His  other opinions indicated the contrary. More specifically, it was from his pen, in Chastleton Corporation vs . Sinclair, 60 where the doctrine that the  judiciary may inquire into whether the emergency was at an end, was given  expression. Thus: ""We repeat what was stated in Block vs .  Hirsh,......, as to the respect due to a declaration of this kind by the  legislature so far as it relates to present facts. But, even as to them, a court is not at  liberty to shut its eyes to an obvious mistake, when the validity of the law  depends upon the truth of what is declared. . . . And still more obviously, so  far as this declaration looks to the future, is can be no more than prophecy,  and is liable to be controlled by events. A law depending upon the existence of an emergency or other certain  state of facts to uphold it may cease to operate if the emergency ceases or the  facts change, even though valid when passed."" 61 13. It may safely be concluded therefore that the role of American  courts concerning the legality of acts taken during a period of martial law is  far from minimal. Why it must be so was  explained by Dean Rostow in this wise: ""Unless the courts require a showing, in  cases like these, of an intelligible relationship between means and ends,  society has lost its basic protection against the abuse of military power. The  general's good intention must be irrelevant. There should be evidence in court that his military judgment had a  suitable basis in fact. As Colonel Fairman , a strong  proponent of widened military discretion, points out: 'When the executive fail or is unable to  satisfy the court of the evident necessity for the extraordinary measures it  has taken, it can hardly expect the court to assume it on faith.'"" 62 This is the way Lasswell would summarize the  matter: ""On the whole, we can  conclude that the courts of this country have a body of ancient principles and  recent precedents that can be used to keep at a minimum unnecessary encroachments  upon private rights by the executive, civil or military. The vigor and sensitiveness with which the  due process clause has been affirmed in the last two decades is, in particular,  an important development."" 63 14. It may be that the approach followed may for some be indicative  of lack of full awareness of today's stern realities. It is my submission that to so view the  transcendental issues before us is to adhere as closely as possible to the  ideal envisioned in Ex parte Milligan: ""The Constitution is a law for rulers  and for people equally in war and in peace and covers with the shield of its  protection all classes of men at all times and under all circumstances."" 64 It is ever timely to reiterate that at the core of constitutionalism is a  robust concern for individual rights. This is not to deny that the judicial process does not take place in a  social void. The questions that call for  decision are to be examined in the total social context with full appreciation  of the environmental facts, whether viewed in its temporal or other relevant  aspects. They have to reconcile  time-tested principles to contemporary problems. Legal norms cannot always stand up against  the pressure of events. The great  unquestioned verities may thus prove to be less than adequate. So much is  conceded. Nonetheless, even with the  additional difficulty that the Court today is compelled to enter terrain with  boundaries not so clearly defined, carrying with it the risk of exceeding the  normal limits of judicial imprecision, I find myself unable to resist the  compulsion of constitutional history and traditional doctrines. The facts and  issues of the petitions before us and the mandates of the fundamental law, as I  view them in the light of accepted concepts, blunt the edge of what otherwise  could be considerations of decisive impact. I find myself troubled by the thought that, were it otherwise, it would  amount to freezing the flux of the turbulent present with its grave and  critical problems in the icy permanence of juristic doctrines. As of now, such an uncomfortable thought  intrudes. Hence this brief concurring  and dissenting opinion. * The other  petitioners are Joaquin P. Roces , Teodoro M.

This is more so when the infringement arises from government  action. When liberty is threatened or  curtailed by private individuals, only a loud cry (in fact, it need not even be  loud) need be made, and the government steps in to prevent the threatened  infringement or to vindicate the consummated curtailment. The action is often swift and effective; the  results generally satisfactory and gratifying. But when the government itself is the 'culprit' the cry need be louder,  for the action is invariably made under color of law or cloaked with the mantle  of authority. The privilege of the writ,  however; because if may be made to bear upon governmental officers, assures  that the individual's cry shall not, at least, be futile and vain.""

SEPARATE OPINION TEEHANKEE, J. : Prefatory statement : This separate opinion was prepared and scheduled to be promulgated with  the judgment of the Court (penned by the Chief Justice) on September 12, 1974 . Such promulgation was however overtaken by  the welcome news of the release from detention on September 11, 1974 of petitioner Jose W. Diokno upon the order of President Ferdinand E. Marcos; and  the Court then resolved to defer promulgation until the following week. Hence, Part I of this opinion dealing with  the Diokno petition should be read in such time  context. The two other parts thereof of dealing with the Aquino and Rodrigo cases are to be read as of the actual  date of promulgation, since they reiterate a main theme of the opinion that the  Court should adhere to file well-grounded principle of not ruling on  constitutional issues except when necessary in an appropriate case. In the writer's view, the gratifying  development in the Diokno case which rendered his  petition moot by virtue of his release once more demonstrates the validity of  this principle. I. On the Diokno petition : I vote for the granting of petitioner Jose W. Diokno's motion of December 29, 1973 to withdraw the petition for habeas corpus filed on  September 23, 1972 on his behalf and the supplemental petition and motions for  immediate release and for oral argument of June 29, 1973 and August 14, 1973  filed in support thereof, as prayed for. 1. The present action is one of habeas corpus and the detainee's  own withdrawal of his petition is decisive. If the detainee himself withdraws his petition and no longer wishes this  Court to pass upon the legality of his detention and cites the other pending  habeas corpus cases which have not been withdrawn and wherein Court can rule on  the constitutional issues if so minded, [1] such withdrawal of a habeas corpus petition should be granted practically as a  matter of absolute right (whatever be the motivations therefor )  in the same manner that the withdrawal motions of the petitioners in the other  cases were previously granted by the Court. [2] Since there were seven (7) members of the Court who voted for  granting the withdrawal motion as against five (5) members who voted for  denying the same and rendering a decision, [3] I  submit that this majority of seven (7) out of the Court's membership of twelve  (12) is a sufficient majority for granting the withdrawal prayed for. A simple majority of seven is legally  sufficient for the granting of a withdrawal of a petition, since it does  not involve the rendition of a decision on the merits. It is only where a decision is to be  rendered on the merits by the Court en banc that the 1973 Constitution  requires the concurrence of at least eight (8) members. [4] I therefore dissent from the majority's adhering to the  five-member minority view that the majority of members seven is not legally  sufficient for granting withdrawal and that a decision on the merits be  rendered notwithstanding the withdrawal of the petition. 2. The granting of the withdrawal of the petition is but in  consonance with the fundamental principle on the exercise of judicial power  which, in the words of the Solicitor-General, ""as Justice Laurel  emphasized, is justifiable only as a necessity for the resolution of an actual  case and controversy and therefore should be confined to the very lis mota presented."" [5] Such withdrawal is furthermore in accord with the respondents'  stand from the beginning urging the Court not to take cognizance (for want of  jurisdiction or as a matter of judicial restraint citing Brandeis' injunction  that ""The most important thing we decide is what not to decide' [6] )  or that ""at the very least, this Court should postpone consideration of  this case until the present emergency is over."" [7] Many of the other petitioners in the habeas corpus cases at bar  were granted leave to withdraw their petitions. Petitioner Diokno's withdrawal motion should  likewise be granted in line with the well-established doctrine that the Court  will not rule on constitutional issues except when necessary in an appropriate  case. 3. But the Solicitor-General now objects to the withdrawal on the  ground of public interest and that ""this Tribunal . . . has been used as  the open forum for underground propaganda by those who have political axes to  grind"" with the circulation of the withdrawal motion and that this Court  would be ""putting the seal of approval"" and in effect admit the  ""unfair, untrue and contemptuous"" statements made in the withdrawal  motion should this Court grant the withdrawal. [8] I  see no point in the position taken by the Solicitor-General of urging the Court  to deny the withdrawal motion only to render a decision that would after all  dismiss the petition and sustain respondents' defense of political question and have the Court declare itself without jurisdiction to adjudicate the  constitutional issues presented [9] and asking the Court to embrace the ""pragmatic method"" of William  James which ""rejects ... the a priori assumption that there are immutable  principles of justice. It tests a  proposition by its practical consequences."" [10] The objections are untenable. The public interest objection is met by the fact that there are  still pending other cases (principally the prohibition case of petitioner Benigno S. Aquino , Jr. in another  case, L-37364 questioning the filing of grave charges under the Anti-Subversion  Act, etc. against him with a military commission [11] and which is not yet submitted for decision) where the same constitutional  issues may be resolved. The other objections are tenuous: The Solicitor-General refutes his own objections in his closing  statement in his comment that ""for their part, respondents are confident  that in the end they would be upheld in their defense, as indeed petitioner and  counsel have practically confessed judgment in this case."" [12] The propaganda objection is not a valid ground for denying the  withdrawal of the petition and should not be held against petitioner who had  nothing whatsoever to do with it. The objection that granting the withdrawal motion would amount to  an admission of the ""unfair, untrue and contemptuous statements"" made  therein is untenable since it is patent that granting the withdrawal motion per  se (regardless of petitioner's reasons) does not amount to an admission of the  truth or validity of such reasons and as conceded by the Solicitor-General,  neither will denying the withdrawal motion per se disprove the reasons. [13] The untruth, unfairness or contumacy of such reasons may best be dealt with,  clarified or expounded by the Court and its members in the Court's resolution  granting withdrawal or in the separate opinions of the individual justices (as  has actually been done and which the writer will now proceed to do). 4. Petitioner's first reason for withdrawal is subjective. After mentioning various factors,  particularly, the fact that five of the six justices (including the writer) who  held in the Ratification cases [14] that the 1973 Constitution had not been validly ratified had taken on October  29, 1973 an oath to support and defend the new Constitution, he expresses his  feeling that ""(I) cannot reasonably expect either right or reason law or  justice, to prevail in my case,"" that ""the unusual length of the  struggle also indicates that its conscience is losing the battle"" and that  ""since I do not wish to be a party to an adverse decision, I must renounce  every possibility of favorable judgment."" [15] A party's subjective evaluation of the Court's action is actually of no moment,  for its has always been recognized that this Court, possessed of neither the  sword nor the purse, must ultimately and objectively rest its authority on  sustained public confidence in the truth, justice, integrity and moral force of  its judgments. [16] Petitioner's second reason for withdrawal reads: “(S) econd , in view  of the new oath that its members have taken, the present Supreme Court is a new  Court functioning under a new 'Constitution,' different from the Court and the  Constitution under which I applied for my release. I was willing to be judged by the old Court  under the old Constitution, but not by the new Court under the new  Constitution. Petitioner is in error in his assumption that this Court is a  ""new Court functioning under a new Constitution different from the Court  and the Constitution under which [he] applied for [his] release."" The same  Supreme Court has continued save that it now operates under Article X of the  1973 Constitution which inter alia increased  its component membership from eleven to fifteen and transferred to it  administrative supervision over all courts and personnel thereof with the power  of discipline and dismissal over judges of inferior courts in the same manner  that the same Republic of the Philippines of which the Supreme Court is but a  part has continued in existence but now operates under the 1973 Constitution.' 18 During the period of ninety days that the Ratification cases were  pending before the Court until its dismissal of the cases per its resolution of  March 31, 1973 became final on April 17, 1973, the Executive Department was  operating under the 1973 Constitution in accordance with President Ferdinand E.  Marcos' Proclamation No. 1102 on January 17, 1973 announcing the ratification  and coming into effect of the 1973 Constitution while this Court as the only  other governmental department continued to operate under the 1935 Constitution  pending its final resolution on the said cases challenging the validity of  Proclamation No. 1102 and enforcement of the new Constitution. (As per the  Court's resolution of January 23, 1973 ,  it declined to take over from the Department of Justice the administrative  supervision over all inferior courts expressing its sense that ""it is best  that the status quo be maintained until the case aforementioned ( Javellana vs . Exec. Secretary) shall have been  finally resolved . . ."") Such a situation could not long endure wherein the only two great  departments of government, the Executive and the Judicial, 19 for a period of three months were operating under two different Constitutions  (presidential and parliamentary). When  this Court's resolution of dismissal of the Ratification cases by a majority of  six to four Justices became final and was entered on April 18, 1973 ""with  the result that there (were) not enough votes to declare that the new  Constitution is not in force, 20 the Court and particularly the  remaining three dissenting Justices (notwithstanding their vote with three  others that the new Constitution had not been validly ratified 21 had to abide under the Rule of Law by the decision of the majority dismissing  the cases brought to enjoin the enforcement by the Executive of the new  Constitution and had to operate under it as the fundamental charter of the  government, unless they were to turn from legitimate dissent to internecine  dissidence for which they have neither the inclination nor the capability. The Court as the head of the Judicial Department thenceforth  assumed the power of administrative supervision over all courts and all other  functions and liabilities imposed on it under the new Constitution.  Accordingly, this Court and all other existing inferior courts continue to  discharge their judicial function and to hear and determine all pending cases  filed or submitted under the old (1935) Constitution 22 as well as new cases under the new (1973) Constitution with the full support of  the members of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (none of whom has made  petitioner's claim that this is a ""new Court"" different from the  ""old Court""). A major liability imposed upon all members of the Court and all  other officials and employees was that under Article XVII, section 9 of the  Transitory Provisions 23 which was destructive of their  tenure and called upon them ""to vacate their respective offices upon the  appointment and qualification of their successors."" Their taking the oath  on October 29, 1973 ""to preserve and defend the new Constitution"" by  virtue of their ""having been continued in office"" 24 on the occasion of the oath-taking of three new members of the Court 25 pursuant to Article XV, section 4 26 was meant to assure their  ""continuity of tenure"" by way of the President having exercised the  power of replacement under the cited provision and in effect replaced them with  themselves as members of the Court with the same order of seniority. 27 5. The withdrawal in effect gives cause for judicial abstention and  further opportunity (pending submittal for decision of the Aquino prohibition case in L-37364) to ponder and deliberate upon the host of grave  and fundamental constitutional questions involved which have thereby been  rendered unnecessary to resolve here and now. In the benchmark case of Lansang vs. Garcia 28 when the Court declared that the President did not act arbitrarily in issuing  in August, 1971 Proclamation No. 889, as amended, suspending the privilege of  the writ of habeas corpus for persons detained for the crimes of insurrection  or rebellion and other overt acts committed by them in furtherance thereof, the  Court held through then Chief Justice Concepcion that  ""our next step would have been the following: The Court, or a commissioner designated by  it, would have received evidence on whether — as stated in respondents' 'Answer  and Return' — said petitioners had been apprehended and detained 'on reasonable  belief' that they had participated in the crime of insurrection or rebellion.' "" (However, since in the interval of two months during the pendency of the case, criminal complaints had been filed in  court against the petitioners-detainees ( Luzvimindo David, Gary Olivar , et al.). the Court found that  ""it is best to let said preliminary examination and/or investigation be  completed, so that petitioners' release could be ordered by the court of first  instance, should it find that there is no probable cause against them, or a  warrant for their arrest could be issued should a probable cause be established  against them."" 29 The Court accordingly ordered the  trial court ""to act with utmost dispatch"" in conducting the  preliminary investigation for violation of the Anti-Subversion Act and ""to  issue the corresponding warrants of arrest, if probable cause is found to exist  against them, or otherwise, to order their release."") Can such a procedure for reception of evidence on the controverted allegations concerning the detention as  indicated in Lansang be likewise applied to  petitioner's case considering his prolonged detention for almost two years now  without charges? 30 It should also be considered that it is conceded that even though the privilege  of the writ of habeas corpus has been suspended, it is suspended only as to  certain specific crimes and the ""answer and return"" of the  respondents who hold the petitioner under detention is not conclusive upon the  courts which may receive evidence and determine as held in Lansang (and as also provided in the Anti-Subversion Act [Republic Act 1700]) whether a  petitioner has been in fact apprehended and detained arbitrarily or  ""on reasonable belief"" that he has ""participated in the crime of  insurrection or rebellion"" or other related offenses as may be enumerated  in the proclamation suspending the privilege of the writ. Pertinent to this question is the Court's adoption in Lansang of the doctrine of Sterling vs.  Constantin 31 enunciated through U.S. Chief Justice Hughes that even when the state has been  placed under martial law ""... ( W) hen there is a substantial showing  that the exertion of state power has overridden private rights secured by  that Constitution, the subject is necessarily one for judicial inquiry in an appropriate proceeding directed against the individuals charged with the  transgression. To such a case the  Federal judicial power extends (Art. 3. sec. 2) and, so extending, the court  has all the authority appropriate to its exercise . . .."" Equally pertinent is the Court's statement therein announcing the  members' unanimous conviction that it has the authority to inquire into the  existence of said factual bases [stated in the proclamation suspending the  privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or placing the country under martial law  as the case may be, since the requirements for the exercise of these powers are  the same and are provided in the very same clause] in order to determine the  constitutional sufficiency thereof."" 32 The Court stressed therein that  ""indeed, the grant of power to suspend the privilege is neither absolute  nor unqualified. The authority conferred  upon by the Constitution, both under the Bill of Rights and under the Executive  Department, is limited and conditional. The precept in the Bill of Rights establishes a general rule, as well as  an exception thereto. What is more, it  postulates the former in the negative evidently to stress its  importance, by providing that '(t)he privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended ...' It is only by way of exception that it  permits the suspension of the privilege 'in cases of invasion, insurrection, or  rebellion' — or under Art. VII of the Constitution imminent danger thereof —  'when the public safety requires it, in any of which events the same may be  suspended wherever during such period the necessity for such suspension shall  exist.' Far from being full and plenary, the authority to suspend the privilege  of the writ is thus circumscribed, confined and restricted, not only by the  prescribed setting or the conditions essential to its existence, but, also, as  regards the time when and the place where it may be exercised. These factors and the aforementioned setting  or conditions mark, establish and define the extent, the confines and the  limits of said power, beyond which it does not exist. And like the limitations and restrictions  imposed, by the Fundamental Law upon the legislative department, adherence  thereto and compliance therewith may, within proper bounds, be inquired into by  the courts of justice. Otherwise, the  explicit constitutional provisions thereon would be meaningless. Surely, the framers of our Constitution could  not have intended to engage in such a wasteful exercise in futility."" 33 While a state of martial law may bar such judicial inquiries  under the writ of habeas corpus in the actual theater of war, would the  proscription apply when martial law is maintained as an instrument of social  reform and the civil courts (as well as military commissions) are open and  freely functioning? What is the extent and scope of the validating provision of  Article XVII, section 3(2) of the Transitory Provisions of the 1973  Constitution? 34 Granting the validation of the initial preventive detention would  the validating provision cover indefinite detention thereafter or may Inquiry  be made as to its reasonable relation to meeting the emergency situation? What rights under the Bill of Rights, e.g. the rights to due  process and to ""speedy, impartial and public trial"" 35 may be invoked under the present state of martial law? Is the exercise of martial law powers for the  institutionalization of reforms incompatible with recognizing the fundamental  liberties granted in the Bill of Rights? The President is well aware of the layman's view of the  ""central problem of constitutionalism in our contemporary society . . .  whether or not the Constitution remains an efficient instrument for the  moderation of conflict within society. There are two aspects of this problem. One is the regulation of freedom in order to prevent anarchy. The other is the limitation of power in order  to prevent tyranny."" 36 Hence, he has declared that ""The New Society looks to  individual rights as a matter of paramount concern, removed from the  vicissitudes of political controversy and beyond the reach of majorities. We are pledged to uphold the Bill of Rights  and as the exigencies may so allow, we are determined that each provision shall  be executed to the fullest,"" 37 and has acknowledged that  ""martial law necessarily creates a command society [and] is a temporary  constitutional expedient of safeguarding the republic . ."" 38 He has thus described the proclamation of martial law and  ""the setting up of a corresponding crisis government"" as  ""constitutional authoritarianism,"" which is a recognition that while  his government is authoritarian it is essentially constitutional and recognizes  the supremacy of the new Constitution. He has further declared that ""martial law should have  legally terminated on January 17, 1973 when the new Constitution was  ratified"", but that ""the popular clamor manifested in the referendum  (was) that the National Assembly be temporarily suspended"" and the  reaction in the July, 1973 referendum ""was violently against stopping the  use of martial law powers,"" adding that ""I intend to submit this  matter at least once a year to the people, and when they say we should shift to  the normal functions of government, then we will do so."" 39 The realization of the prospects for restoration of normalcy and  full implementation of each and every provision of the Bill of Rights as  pledged by the President would then hopefully come sooner rather than later and  provides an additional weighty reason for the exercise of judicial abstention  under the environmental circumstances and for the granting of the withdrawal  motion. II. In the Aquino case: I maintain my original vote as first  unanimously agreed by the Court for dismissal of the habeas corpus petition of Benigno S. Aquino , Jr. on the  ground that grave, charges against him for violation of the Anti-Subversion Act  (Republic Act 1700], etc. were filed in August 1973 and hence the present  petition has been superseded by the prohibition case then filed by him  questioning the filing of the charges against him with a military commission  rather than with the civil courts (which case is not yet submitted for  decision). The said prohibition case involves the same constitutional issues  raised in the Diokno case and more, concerning the  constitutionality of having him tried by a military commission for offenses  allegedly committed by him long before the declaration of martial law. This is evident from the special and  affirmative defenses raised in respondents' answer therein filed just last August 21, 1974 by the Solicitor  General which reiterate the same defenses in his answer to the petition at  bar. Hence, the same constitutional  issues may well be resolved if necessary in the decision yet to be rendered by  the Court in said prohibition case. I therefore dissent from the subsequent vote of the majority to  instead pass upon and resolve in advance the said constitutional issues  unnecessarily in the present case. III. In the Rodrigo case : I submit that the habeas corpus petition of Francisco ""Soc""  Rodrigo as well as the petitions of those others similarly released should be  dismissed for having been rendered moot and academic by virtue of their release  from physical confinement and detention. That their release has been made subject to certain conditions (e.g. not  being allowed to leave the Greater Manila area without specific authorization  of the military authorities) does not mean that their action would survive,  since ""(T)he restraint of liberty which would justify the issuance of the  writ must be more than a mere moral restraint; it must be actual or  physical.""40 They may have some other judicial recourse for the removal of  such restraints but their action for habeas corpus cannot survive since they  are no longer deprived of their physical liberty. For these reasons and those already expounded  hereinabove, I dissent from the majority vote to pass upon and resolve in  advance the constitutional issues unnecessarily in the present case.

The Solicitor-General's  line of argument: ""(T)he charge in  the case at bar goes to the very foundations of our system of justice and the  respect that is due to it. It is  subversive of public confidence in the impartiality and independence of courts  and tends to embarrass the administration of justice. As has been aptly said, 'The Court's  authority -- possessed of neither the purse nor the sword — ultimately rests on  sustained public confidence in its moral sanction. Such feeling must be  nourished by the Court's complete detachment, in fact and in appearnace from political entanglements and by abstention  from injecting itself into the clash of political forces in political  settlements.' (Baker vs . Carr. 369 U.S. 186, 266, 267, Frankfurter. J. dissenting [1962].) ""Unless, therefore, the charge  is rectified anything this Court will do in the case at bar is likely to be  misconstrued in the public mind. If this  Court decides this case and renders judgment against petitioner its decision is  likely to be misinterpreted either as a vindictive action taken against the  petitioner or as proving his charge. If  it grants the Motion to Withdraw it will be confessing the very judgment  expressed by the Petitioner — that this Court cannot do justice in this  case. Perhaps the only way open for it  would be to render judgment for the petitioner, although then others will  likely think that the Court is reacting to the charge. 'It is this harmful  obstruction and hindrance that the judiciary strives to avoid, under penalty of  contempt,' as this Court explained in another case. ( Herras Teehankee vs .

No. 167011. April 30, 2008 ] SPOUSES CARLOS S. ROMUALDEZ AND ERLINDA R. ROMUALDEZ, PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND DENNIS GARAY, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N CHICO-NAZARIO, J.: This treats of the Petition for Review on Certiorari with a prayer for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction filed by petitioners Spouses Carlos S. Romualdez and Erlinda R. Romualdez seeking to annul and set aside the Resolutions, dated 11 June 2004 [1] and 27 January 2005 [2] of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) in E.O. Case No. 2000-36. In the Resolution of 11 June 2004, the COMELEC En Banc directed the Law Department to file the appropriate Information with the proper court against petitioners Carlos S. Romualdez and Erlinda Romualdez for violation of Section 10(g) and (j) [3] in relation to Section 45(j) [4] of Republic Act No. 8189, otherwise known as The Voter's Registration Act of 1996. [5] Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration thereon was denied. The factual antecedents leading to the instant Petition are presented hereunder: On 12 July 2000, private respondent Dennis Garay, along with Angelino Apostol [6] filed a Complaint-Affidavit [7] with the COMELEC thru the Office of the Election Officer in Burauen, Leyte, charging petitioners with violation of Section 261(y)(2) [8] and Section 261(y)(5) [9] of the Omnibus Election Code, similarly referred to as Batas Pambansa Blg. 881; and Section 12 [10] of Republic Act No. 8189. Private respondent deposed, inter alia , that: petitioners are of legal ages and residents of 113 Mariposa Loop, Mariposa Street, Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, Quezon City; on 9 May 2000 and 11 May 2000, petitioners Carlos S. Romualdez and Erlinda R. Romualdez, applied for registration as new voters with the Office of the Election Officer of Burauen, Leyte, as evidenced by Voter Registration Record Nos. 42454095 and 07902952, respectively; in their sworn applications, petitioners made false and untruthful representations in violation of Section 10 [11] of Republic Act Nos. 8189, by indicating therein that they are residents of 935 San Jose Street, Burauen, Leyte, when in truth and in fact, they were and still are residents of 113 Mariposa Loop, Mariposa Street, Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, Quezon City, and registered voters of Barangay Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, District IV, Quezon City, Precinct No. 4419-A, as evidenced by Voter Registration Record Nos. 26195824 and 26195823; and that petitioners, knowing fully well said truth, intentionally and willfully, did not fill the blank spaces in said applications corresponding to the length of time which they have resided in Burauen, Leyte. In fine, private respondent charged petitioners, to wit: Respondent-spouses, Carlos Sison Romualdez and Erlinda Reyes Romualdez committed and consummated election offenses in violation of our election laws, specifically, Sec. 261, paragraph (y), subparagraph (2), for knowingly making any false or untruthful statements relative to any data or information required in the application for registration, and of Sec. 261, paragraph (y), subparagraph (5), committed by any person who, being a registered voter, registers anew without filing an application for cancellation of his previous registration, both of the Omnibus Election Code (BP Blg. 881), and of Sec. 12, RA 8189 (Voter Registration Act) for failure to apply for transfer of registration records due to change of residence to another city or municipality."" [12] The Complaint-Affidavit contained a prayer that a preliminary investigation be conducted by the COMELEC, and if the evidence so warrants, the corresponding Information against petitioners be filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) for the prosecution of the same. Petitioners filed a Joint Counter-Affidavit with Motion to Dismiss [13] dated 2 April 2001. They contended therein that they did not make any false or untruthful statements in their application for registration. They avowed that they intended to reside in Burauen, Leyte, since the year 1989. On 9 May 2000, they took actual residence in Burauen, Leyte, by leasing for five (5) years, the house of Juanito and Fe Renomeron at No. 935, San Jose Street in Burauen, Leyte. On even date, the Barangay District III Council of Burauen passed a Resolution of Welcome, expressing therein its gratitude and appreciation to petitioner Carlos S. Romualdez for choosing the Barangay as his official residence. [14] On 28 November 2003, Atty. Maria Norina S. Tangaro-Casingal, COMELEC Investigating Officer, issued a Resolution, recommending to the COMELEC Law Department (Investigation and Prosecution Division), the filing of the appropriate Information against petitioners, disposing, thus: PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Law Department (Investigation and Prosecution Division), RECOMMENDS to file the necessary information against Carlos Sison Romualdez before the proper Regional Trial Court for violation of Section 10 (g) and (j) in relation to Section 45 (j) of Republic Act 8189 and to authorize the Director IV of the Law Department to designate a Comelec Prosecutor to handle the prosecution of the case with the duty to submit periodic report after every hearing of the case. [15] On 11 June 2004, the COMELEC En Banc found no reason to depart from the recommendatory Resolution of 28 November 2003, and ordered, viz : WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Law Department is hereby directed to file the appropriate information with the proper court against respondents CARLOS S. ROMUALDEZ AND ERLINDA ROMUALDEZ for violation of Section 10 (g) and (j) in relation to Section 45 (j) of the Republic Act No. 8189. [16] Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration thereon. Acting on the Motion, the COMELEC found no cogent reason to disturb the assailed En Banc Resolution of 11 June 2004, [17] rationalizing, thus: However, perusal of the records reveal (sic) that the arguments and issues raised in the Motion for Reconsideration are merely a rehash of the arguments advanced by the Respondents in [their] Memorandum received by the Law Department on 17 April 2001, the same [w]as already considered by the Investigating Officer and was discussed in her recommendation which eventually was made as the basis for the En Banc's resolution. As aptly observed by the Investigating Officer, the filing of request for the cancellation and transfer of Voting Registration Record does not automatically cancel the registration records. The fact remains that at the time of application for registration as new voter of the herein Respondents on May 9 and 11, 2001 in the Office of Election Officer of Burauen, Leyte their registration in Barangay 4419-A, Barangay Bagong Lipunan ng Crame Quezon City was still valid and subsisting. [18] On 12 January 2006, Alioden D. Dalaig, Director IV, Law Department of the COMELEC filed with the RTC, Burauen, Leyte, separate Informations against petitioner Carlos S. Romualdez [19] for violation of Section 10(g), in relation to Section 45(j) of Republic Act No. 8189, and against petitioner Erlinda R. Romualdez [20] for violation of Section 10(g), in relation to Section 45(j) of Republic Act No. 8189, subsequently docketed as Crim. Case No. BN-06-03-4185 and Crim. Case No. BN-06-03-4183, respectively. Moreover, separate Informations for violation of Section 10(j), in relation to Section 45(j) of Republic Act No. 8189 were filed against petitioners. [21] Hence, petitioners come to us via the instant Petition, submitting the following arguments: I RESPONDENT COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF OR IN EXCESS OF ITS JURISDICTION; and II COMELEC GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT PREMISED ITS RESOLUTION ON A MISAPPREHENSION OF FACTS AND FAILED TO CONSIDER CERTAIN RELEVANT FACTS THAT WOULD JUSTIFY A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION. [22] On 4 May 2006, petitioners filed a Motion Reiterating Prayer for Issuance of Writ of Preliminary Injunction and to Cite for Indirect Contempt, [23] alleging that two separate Informations, both dated 12 January 2006, were filed with the RTC by the COMELEC against petitioner Carlos S. Romualdez for violation of Section 10(j), in relation to Section 45(j) of Republic Act No. 8189, in Criminal Case No. BN-06-03-9184; and for violation of Section 10(g), in relation to Section 45(j) of Republic Act No. 8189, in Criminal Case No. BN-06-03-9185. Similarly, the Motion alleged that the COMELEC filed with the RTC, two separate Informations, both dated 12 January 2006, against petitioner Erlinda R. Romualdez, charging her with the same offenses as those charged against petitioner Carlos S. Romualdez, and thereafter, docketed as Criminal Case No. BN-06-03-9182, and No. BN-06-03-9183. On 20 June 2006, this Court issued a Resolution [24] denying for lack of merit petitioners' Motion Reiterating Prayer for Issuance of Writ of Preliminary Injunction and to Cite for Indirect Contempt. We shall now resolve, in seriatim, the arguments raised by petitioners. Petitioners contend that the election offenses for which they are charged by private respondent are entirely different from those which they stand to be accused of before the RTC by the COMELEC. According to petitioners, private respondent's complaint charged them for allegedly violating, to wit: 1) Section 261(y)(2) and Section 261(y)(5) of the Omnibus Election Code, and 2) Section 12 of the Voter's Registration Act; however, the COMELEC En Banc directed in the assailed Resolutions, that they be charged for violations of Section 10(g) and (j), in relation to Section 45(j) of the Voter's Registration Act. Essentially, petitioners are of the view that they were not accorded due process of law. Specifically, their right to refute or submit documentary evidence against the new charges which COMELEC ordered to be filed against them. Moreover, petitioners insist that Section 45(j) of the Voter's Registration Act is vague as it does not refer to a definite provision of the law, the violation of which would constitute an election offense; hence, it runs contrary to Section 14(1) [25] and Section 14(2), [26] Article III of the 1987 Constitution. We are not persuaded. First. The Complaint-Affidavit filed by private respondent with the COMELEC is couched in a language which embraces the allegations necessary to support the charge for violation of Section 10(g) and (j), in relation to Section 45(j) of Republic Act No. 8189. A reading of the relevant laws is in order, thus: Section 10(g) and Section 10(j) of Republic Act No. 8189, provide as follows: SEC. 10 - Registration of Voters. - A qualified voter shall be registered in the permanent list of voters in a precinct of the city or municipality wherein he resides to be able to vote in any election. To register as a voter, he shall personally accomplish an application form for registration as prescribed by the Commission in three (3) copies before the Election Officer on any date during office hours after having acquired the qualifications of a voter. The application shall contain the following data: x x x x (g) Periods of residence in the Philippines and in the place of registration; x x x x (j) A statement that the application is not a registered voter of any precinct; The application for registration shall contain three (3) specimen signatures of the applicant, clear and legible rolled prints of his left and right thumbprints, with four identification size copies of his latest photograph, attached thereto, to be taken at the expense of the Commission. Before the applicant accomplishes his application for registration, the Election Officer shall inform him of the qualifications and disqualifications prescribed by law for a voter, and thereafter, see to it that the accomplished application contains all the data therein required and that the applicant's specimen signatures, fingerprints, and photographs are properly affixed in all copies of the voter's application. Moreover, Section 45(j) of the same Act, recites, thus: SEC. 45. Election Offense. - The following shall be considered election offenses under this Act: x x x x (j) Violation of any of the provisions of this Act. Significantly, the allegations in the Complaint-Affidavit which was filed with the Law Department of the COMELEC, support the charge directed by the COMELEC En Banc to be filed against petitioners with the RTC. Even a mere perusal of the Complaint-Affidavit would readily show that Section 10 of Republic Act No. 8189 was specifically mentioned therein. On the matter of the acts covered by Section 10(g) and (j), the Complaint-Affidavit, spells out the following allegations, to wit: Respondent-spouses made false and untruthful representations in their applications (Annexes ""B"" and ""C"") in violation of the requirements of Section 10, RA 8189 (The Voter's Registration Act): 5.1 Respondent-spouses, in their sworn applications (Annexes ""B"" and ""C"", claimed to be residents of 935 San Jose [S]treet, Burauen, Leyte, when in truth and in fact, they were and still are residents of 113 Mariposa Loop, Mariposa [S]treet, Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, Quezon City and registered voters of Barangay Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, District IV, Quezon City, Precinct No. 4419-A, a copy of the Certification issued by Hon. Emmanuel V. Gozon, Punong Barangay, Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, Quezon City is hereto attached and made an integral part hereof, as Annex ""D""; 5.2 Respondent-spouses knowing fully well said truth, intentionally and willfully, did not fill the blank spaces in their applications (Annexes ""B"" and ""C"") corresponding to the length of time they have resided in Burauen, Leyte; Respondent-spouses, in (sic) all intents and purposes, were and still are residents and registered voters of Quezon City, as evidenced by Voter Registration Record Nos. 26195824 and 26195823, respectively; photocopies of which are hereto attached as Annexes ""E"" and ""F""[.] Likewise, attached is a ""Certification"" (Annex ""G"") of Ms. Evelyn B. Bautista, Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Election Officer, Fourth District, Quezon City, dated May 31, 2000, together with a certified copy of the computer print-out of the list of voters of Precinct No. 4419-A (Annex ""G-1"" ) containing the names of voters Carlos Romualdez and Erlinda Reyes Romualdez. The Certification reads as follows: ""THIS IS TO CERTIFY that as per office record MR. CARLOS ROMUALDEZ and MS. ERLINDA REYES ROMUALDEZ are registered voters of Barangay Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, District IV, Quezon City, Precinct Number 4419A with voters affidavit serial nos. 26195824 and 26195823, respectively. This certification is issued for whatever legal purpose it may serve."" Respondent-spouses, registered as new voters of the Municipality of Burauen, Leyte, [in spite of] the fact that they were and still are, registered voters of Quezon City as early as June 22, 1997; 7.1 That, Double Registration is an election offense. A person qualified as a voter is only allowed to register once. If a person registers anew as a voter in spite of a subsisting registration, the new application for registration will be disapproved. The registrant is also liable not only for an election offense of double registration, but also for another election offense of knowingly making any false or untruthful statement relative to any data or information required in the application for registration. In fact, when a person applies for registration as a voter, he or she fills up a Voter Registration Record form in his or her own handwriting, which contains a Certification which reads: ""I do solemnly swear that the above statements regarding my person are true and correct; that I possess all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications of a voter; that the thumbprints, specimen signatures and photographs appearing herein are mine; and that I am not registered as a voter in any other precinct. "" [27] Petitioners cannot be said to have been denied due process on the claim that the election offenses charged against them by private respondent are entirely different from those for which they stand to be accused of before the RTC, as charged by the COMELEC. In the first place, there appears to be no incongruity between the charges as contained in the Complaint-Affidavit and the Informations filed before the RTC, notwithstanding the denomination by private respondent of the alleged violations to be covered by Section 261(y)(2) and Section 261(y)(5) of the Omnibus Election Code and Section 12 of Republic Act No. 8189. Evidently, the Informations directed to be filed by the COMELEC against petitioners, and which were, in fact, filed with the RTC, were based on the same set of facts as originally alleged in the private respondent's Complaint-Affidavit. Petitioners buttress their claim of lack of due process by relying on the case of Lacson v. Executive Secretary. [28] Citing Lacson, petitioners argue that the real nature of the criminal charge is determined by the actual recital of facts in the Complaint or Information; and that the object of such written accusations was to furnish the accused with such a description of the charge against him, as will enable him to make his defense. Let it be said that, in Lacson, this court resolved the issue of whether under the allegations in the subject Informations therein, it is the Sandiganbayan or the Regional Trial Court which has jurisdiction over the multiple murder case against therein petitioner and intervenors. In Lacson, we underscored the elementary rule that the jurisdiction of a court is determined by the allegations in the Complaint or Information, and not by the evidence presented by the parties at the trial. [29] Indeed, in Lacson , we articulated that the real nature of the criminal charge is determined not from the caption or preamble of the Information nor from the specification of the provision of law alleged to have been violated, they being conclusions of law, but by the actual recital of facts in the Complaint or Information. [30] Petitioners' reliance on Lacson , however, does not support their claim of lack of due process because, as we have said, the charges contained in private respondent's Complaint-Affidavit and the charges as directed by the COMELEC to be filed are based on the same set of facts. In fact, the nature of the criminal charges in private respondent's Complaint-Affidavit and that of the charges contained in the Informations filed with the RTC, pursuant to the COMELEC Resolution En Banc are the same, such that, petitioners cannot claim that they were not able to refute or submit documentary evidence against the charges that the COMELEC filed with the RTC. Petitioners were afforded due process because they were granted the opportunity to refute the allegations in private respondent's Complaint-Affidavit. On 2 April 2001, in opposition to the Complaint-Affidavit, petitioners filed a Joint Counter-Affidavit with Motion to Dismiss with the Law Department of the COMELEC. They similarly filed a Memorandum before the said body. Finding that due process was not dispensed with under the circumstances in the case at bar, we agree with the stance of the Office of the Solicitor General that petitioners were reasonably apprised of the nature and description of the charges against them. It likewise bears stressing that preliminary investigations were conducted whereby petitioners were informed of the complaint and of the evidence submitted against them. They were given the opportunity to adduce controverting evidence for their defense. In all these stages, petitioners actively participated. The instant case calls to our minds Orquinaza v. People , [31] wherein the concerned police officer therein designated the offense charged as sexual harassment; but, the prosecutor found that there was no transgression of the anti-sexual harassment law, and instead, filed an Information charging therein petitioner with acts of lasciviousness. On a claim that there was deprivation of due process, therein petitioner argued that the Information for acts of lasciviousness was void as the preliminary investigation conducted was for sexual harassment. The court held that the designation by the police officer of the offense is not conclusive as it is within the competence of the prosecutor to assess the evidence submitted and determine therefrom the appropriate offense to be charged. Accordingly, the court pronounced that the complaint contained all the allegations to support the charge of acts of lasciviousness under the Revised Penal Code; hence, the conduct of another preliminary investigation for the offense of acts of lasciviousness would be a futile exercise because the complainant would only be presenting the same facts and evidence which have already been studied by the prosecutor. [32] The court frowns upon such superfluity which only serves to delay the prosecution and disposition of the criminal complaint. [33] Second. Petitioners would have this court declare Section 45(j) of Republic Act No. 8189 vague, on the ground that it contravenes the fair notice requirement of the 1987 Constitution, in particular, Section 14(1) and Section 14(2), Article III of thereof. Petitioners submit that Section 45(j) of Republic Act No. 8189 makes no reference to a definite provision of the law, the violation of which would constitute an election offense. We are not convinced. The void-for-vagueness doctrine holds that a law is facially invalid if men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. [34] However, this Court has imposed certain limitations by which a criminal statute, as in the challenged law at bar, may be scrutinized. This Court has declared that facial invalidation [35] or an ""on-its-face"" invalidation of criminal statutes is not appropriate. [36] We have so enunciated in no uncertain terms in Romualdez v. Sandiganbayan , [37] thus: In sum, the doctrines of strict scrutiny, overbreadth, and vagueness are analytical tools developed for testing on their faces statutes in free speech cases or, as they are called in American law, First Amendment cases. They cannot be made to do service when what is involved is a criminal statute. With respect to such statute, the established rule is that 'one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional.' As has been pointed out, 'vagueness challenges in the First Amendment context, like overbreadth challenges typically produce facial invalidation, while statutes found vague as a matter of due process typically are invalidated [only] 'as applied' to a particular defendant.' (underscoring supplied) To this date, the Court has not declared any penal law unconstitutional on the ground of ambiguity. While mentioned in passing in some cases, the void-for-vagueness concept has yet to find direct application in our jurisdiction. In Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad, the Bookkeeping Act was found unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clause, not because it was vague. Adiong v. Comelec decreed as void a mere Comelec Resolution, not a statute. Finally, Santiago v. Comelec held that a portion of RA 6735 was unconstitutional because of undue delegation of legislative powers, not because of vagueness. Indeed, an on-its-face invalidation of criminal statutes would result in a mass acquittal of parties whose cases may not have even reached the courts. Such invalidation would constitute a departure from the usual requirement of actual case and controversy and permit decisions to be made in a sterile abstract context having no factual concreteness. In Younger v. Harris, this evil was aptly pointed out by the U.S. Supreme Court in these words: [T]he task of analyzing a proposed statute, pinpointing its deficiencies, and requiring correction of these deficiencies before the statute is put into effect, is rarely if ever an appropriate task for the judiciary. The combination of the relative remoteness of the controversy, the impact on the legislative process of the relief sought, and above all the speculative and amorphous nature of the required line-by-line analysis of detailed statutes, x x x ordinarily results in a kind of case that is wholly unsatisfactory for deciding constitutional questions, whichever way they might be decided. For this reason, generally disfavored is an on-its-face invalidation of statutes, described as a manifestly strong medicine to be employed sparingly and only as a last resort. In determining the constitutionality of a statute, therefore, its provisions that have allegedly been violated must be examined in the light of the conduct with which the defendant has been charged. (Emphasis supplied.) At the outset, we declare that under these terms, the opinions of the dissent which seek to bring to the fore the purported ambiguities of a long list of provisions in Republic Act No. 8189 can be deemed as a facial challenge. An appropriate ""as applied"" challenge in the instant Petition should be limited only to Section 45 (j) in relation to Sections 10 (g) and (j) of Republic Act No. 8189--the provisions upon which petitioners are charged. An expanded examination of the law covering provisions which are alien to petitioners' case would be antagonistic to the rudiment that for judicial review to be exercised, there must be an existing case or controversy that is appropriate or ripe for determination, and not conjectural or anticipatory. We further quote the relevant ruling in David v. Arroyo on the proscription anent a facial challenge: [38] Moreover, the overbreadth doctrine is not intended for testing the validity of a law that reflects legitimate state interest in maintaining comprehensive control over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct. Undoubtedly, lawless violence, insurrection and rebellion are considered harmful and constitutionally unprotected conduct. In Broadrick v. Oklahoma, it was held: It remains a matter of no little difficulty to determine when a law may properly be held void on its face and when such summary action is inappropriate. But the plain import of our cases is, at the very least, that facial overbreadth adjudication is an exception to our traditional rules of practice and that its function, a limited one at the outset, attenuates as the otherwise unprotected behavior that it forbids the State to sanction moves from pure speech toward conduct and that conduct even if expressive falls within the scope of otherwise valid criminal laws that reflect legitimate state interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct . Thus, claims of facial overbreadth are entertained in cases involving statutes which, by their terms , seek to regulate only spoken words and again, that overbreadth claims, if entertained at all, have been curtailed when invoked against ordinary criminal laws that are sought to be applied to protected conduct . Here, the incontrovertible fact remains that PP 1017 pertains to a spectrum of conduct , not free speech, which is manifestly subject to state regulation. Second, facial invalidation of laws is considered as manifestly strong medicine , to be used sparingly and only as a last resort , and is generally disfavored ; The reason for this is obvious. Embedded in the traditional rules governing constitutional adjudication is the principle that a person to whom a law may be applied will not be heard to challenge a law on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others, i.e., in other situations not before the Court. A writer and scholar in Constitutional Law explains further: The most distinctive feature of the overbreadth technique is that it marks an exception to some of the usual rules of constitutional litigation. Ordinarily, a particular litigant claims that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to him or her; if the litigant prevails, the courts carve away the unconstitutional aspects of the law by invalidating its improper applications on a case to case basis. Moreover, challengers to a law are not permitted to raise the rights of third parties and can only assert their own interests. In overbreadth analysis, those rules give way; challenges are permitted to raise the rights of third parties ; and the court invalidates the entire statute on its face, not merely as applied for so that the overbroad law becomes unenforceable until a properly authorized court construes it more narrowly. The factor that motivates courts to depart from the normal adjudicatory rules is the concern with the chilling; deterrent effect of the overbroad statute on third parties not courageous enough to bring suit. The Court assumes that an overbroad laws very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression. An overbreadth ruling is designed to remove that deterrent effect on the speech of those third parties. In other words, a facial challenge using the overbreadth doctrine will require the Court to examine PP 1017 and pinpoint its flaws and defects, not on the basis of its actual operation to petitioners, but on the assumption or prediction that its very existence may cause others not before the Court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression. xxx          xxx          xxx And third, a facial challenge on the ground of overbreadth is the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that there can be no instance when the assailed law may be valid . Here, petitioners did not even attempt to show whether this situation exists. Petitioners likewise seek a facial review of PP 1017 on the ground of vagueness. This, too, is unwarranted. Related to the overbreadth doctrine is the void for vagueness doctrine which holds that a law is facially invalid if men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. It is subject to the same principles governing overbreadth doctrine. For one, it is also an analytical tool for testing on their faces statutes in free speech cases . And like overbreadth, it is said that a litigant may challenge a statute on its face only if it is vague in all its possible applications. Be that as it may, the test in determining whether a criminal statute is void for uncertainty is whether the language conveys a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice. [39] This Court has similarly stressed that the vagueness doctrine merely requires a reasonable degree of certainty for the statute to be upheld - not absolute precision or mathematical exactitude. [40] As structured, Section 45 [41] of Republic Act No. 8189 makes a recital of election offenses under the same Act. Section 45(j) is, without doubt, crystal in its specification that a violation of any of the provisions of Republic Act No. 8189 is an election offense. The language of Section 45(j) is precise. The challenged provision renders itself to no other interpretation. A reading of the challenged provision involves no guesswork. We do not see herein an uncertainty that makes the same vague. Notably, herein petitioners do not cite a word in the challenged provision, the import or meaning of which they do not understand. This is in stark contrast to the case of Estrada v. Sandiganbayan [42] where therein petitioner sought for statutory definition of particular words in the challenged statute. Even then, the Court in Estrada rejected the argument. This Court reasoned: The rationalization seems to us to be pure sophistry. A statute is not rendered uncertain and void merely because general terms are used therein, or because of the employment of terms without defining them; much less do we have to define every word we use. Besides, there is no positive constitutional or statutory command requiring the legislature to define each and every word in an enactment. Congress is not restricted in the form of expression of its will, and its inability to so define the words employed in a statute will not necessarily result in the vagueness or ambiguity of the law so long as the legislative will is clear, or at least, can be gathered from the whole act, which is distinctly expressed in the Plunder Law. Moreover, it is a well-settled principle of legal hermeneutics that words of a statute will be interpreted in their natural, plain and ordinary acceptation and signification, unless it is evident that the legislature intended a technical or special legal meaning to those words. The intention of the lawmakers who are, ordinarily, untrained philologists and lexicographers to use statutory phraseology in such a manner is always presumed. Perforce, this Court has underlined that an act will not be held invalid merely because it might have been more explicit in its wordings or detailed in its provisions, especially where, because of the nature of the act, it would be impossible to provide all the details in advance as in all other statutes. [43] The evident intent of the legislature in including in the catena of election offenses the violation of any of the provisions of Republic Act No. 8189, is to subsume as punishable, not only the commission of proscribed acts, but also the omission of acts enjoined to be observed. On this score, the declared policy of Republic Act No. 8189 is illuminating. The law articulates the policy of the State to systematize the present method of registration in order to establish a clean, complete, permanent and updated list of voters. A reading of Section 45 (j) conjointly with the provisions upon which petitioners are charged, i.e., Sections 10 (g) and (j) would reveal that the matters that are required to be set forth under the aforesaid sections are crucial to the achievement of a clean, complete, permanent and updated list of voters. The factual information required by the law is sought not for mere embellishment. There is a definitive governmental purpose when the law requires that such facts should be set forth in the application. The periods of residence in the Philippines and in the place of registration delve into the matter of residency, a requisite which a voter must satisfy to be deemed a qualified voter and registered in the permanent list of voters in a precinct of the city or municipality wherein he resides. Of even rationality exists in the case of the requirement in Section 10 (j), mandating that the applicant should state that he/she is not a registered voter of any precinct. Multiple voting by so-called flying voters are glaring anomalies which this country strives to defeat. The requirement that such facts as required by Section 10 (g) and Section 10 (j) be stated in the voter's application form for registration is directly relevant to the right of suffrage, which the State has the right to regulate. It is the opportune time to allude to the case of People v. Gatchalian [44] where the therein assailed law contains a similar provision as herein assailed before us. Republic Act No. 602 also penalizes any person who willfully violates any of the provisions of the Act. The Court dismissed the challenged, and declared the provision constitutional. The Court in Gatchalian read the challenged provision, ""any of the provisions of this [A]ct"" conjointly with Section 3 thereof which was the pertinent portion of the law upon which therein accused was prosecuted. Gatchalian considered the terms as all-embracing; hence, the same must include what is enjoined in Section 3 thereof which embodies the very fundamental purpose for which the law has been adopted. This Court ruled that the law by legislative fiat intends to punish not only those expressly declared unlawful but even those not so declared but are clearly enjoined to be observed to carry out the fundamental purpose of the law. [45] Gatchalian remains good law, and stands unchallenged. It also does not escape the mind of this Court that the phraseology in Section 45(j) is employed by Congress in a number of our laws. [46] These provisions have not been declared unconstitutional. Moreover, every statute has in its favor the presumption of validity. [47] To justify its nullification, there must be a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution, and not one that is doubtful, speculative or argumentative. [48] We hold that petitioners failed to overcome the heavy presumption in favor of the law. Its constitutionality must be upheld in the absence of substantial grounds for overthrowing the same. A salient point. Courts will refrain from touching upon the issue of constitutionality unless it is truly unavoidable and is the very lis mota . In the case at bar, the lis mota is the alleged grave abuse of discretion of the COMELEC in finding probable cause for the filing of criminal charges against petitioners. Third. Petitioners maintain that the COMELEC En Banc, premised its finding on a misapprehension of facts, and committed grave abuse of discretion in directing the filing of Informations against them with the RTC. We are once again unimpressed. The constitutional grant of prosecutorial power in the COMELEC finds statutory expression under Section 265 [49] of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, otherwise known as the Omnibus Election Code. [50] The task of the COMELEC whenever any election offense charge is filed before it is to conduct the preliminary investigation of the case, and make a determination of probable cause. Under Section 8(b), Rule 34 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, the investigating officer makes a determination of whether there is a reasonable ground to believe that a crime has been committed. [51] In Baytan v. COMELEC, [52] this Court, sufficiently elucidated on the matter of probable cause in the prosecution of election offenses, viz : It is also well-settled that the finding of probable cause in the prosecution of election offenses rests in the COMELEC's sound discretion. The COMELEC exercises the constitutional authority to investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute cases for violation of election laws, including acts or omissions constituting election frauds, offense and malpractices. Generally, the Court will not interfere with such finding of the COMELEC absent a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion. This principle emanates from the COMELEC's exclusive power to conduct preliminary investigation of all election offenses punishable under the election laws and to prosecute the same, except as may otherwise be provided by law. [53] It is succinct that courts will not substitute the finding of probable cause by the COMELEC in the absence of grave abuse of discretion. The abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or hostility. [54] According to the COMELEC En Banc, the investigating officer, in the case at bar, held that there was sufficient cause for the filing of criminal charges against petitioners, and found no reason to depart therefrom. Without question, on May 9 and 11 of 2001, petitioners applied for registration as new voters with the Office of the Election Officer of Burauen, Leyte, notwithstanding the existence of petitioners' registration records as registered voters of Precinct No. 4419-A of Barangay Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, District IV, Quezon City. The directive by the COMELEC which affirmed the Resolution [55] of 28 November 2000 of Investigating Officer Atty. Tangaro-Casingal does not appear to be wanting in factual basis, such that a reasonably prudent man would conclude that there exists probable cause to hold petitioners for trial. Thus, in the aforesaid Resolution, the Investigating Officer, found: A violation therefore of Section 10 of Republic Act No. 8189 is an election offense. In the instant case, when respondents Carlos Romualdez and Erlinda Romualdez filed their respective applications for registration as new voters with the Office of the Election Officer of Burauen, Leyte on May 9 and 11, 2001, respectively, they stated under oath that they are not registered voters in other precinct (VRR Nos. 42454095 and 07902941). However, contrary to their statements, records show they are still registered voters of Precinct No. 4419-A, barangay Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, District IV, Quezon City, as per VRR Nos. 26195825 and 26195823. In other words, respondents' registration records in Quezon City is (sic) still in existence. While it may be true that respondents had written the City Election Officer of District IV, Quezon City for cancellation of their voter's registration record as voter's (sic) therein, they cannot presume that the same will be favorably acted upon. Besides, RA 8189 provides for the procedure in cases of transfer of residence to another city/municipality which must be complied with, to wit: ""Section 12. Change of Residence to Another City or Municipality. - Any registered voter who has transferred residence to another city or municipality may apply with the Election Officer of his new residence for the transfer of his registration records. The application for transfer of registration shall be subject to the requirements of notice and hearing and the approval of the Election Registration Board, in accordance with this Act. Upon approval, of the application for transfer, and after notice of such approval to the Election Officer of their former residence of the voter, said Election Officer shall transmit by registered mail the voter's registration record to the Election Officer of the voter's new residence."" They cannot claim ignorance of the abovestated provision on the procedure for transfer of registration records by reason of transferred new residence to another municipality. Based on the affidavit executed by one Eufemia S. Cotoner, she alleged that the refusal of the Assistant Election Officer Ms. Estrella Perez to accept the letter of respondents was due to improper procedure because respondents should have filed the required request for transfer with the Election Officer of Burauen, Leyte. Despite this knowledge, however, they proceeded to register as new voters of Burauen, Leyte, notwithstanding the existence of their previous registrations in Quezon City. In their subsequent affidavit of Transfer of Voters Registration under Section 12 of Republic Act 8189, respondents admitted that they erroneously filed an application as a new voter (sic) with the office of the Election Officer of Burauen, Leyte, by reason of an honest mistake, which they now desire to correct. (underscoring ours). Respondents lose sight of the fact that a statutory offense, such as violation of election law, is mala prohibita . Proof of criminal intent is not necessary. Good faith, ignorance or lack of malice is beside the point. Commission of the act is sufficient. It is the act itself that is punished. x x x x In view of the foregoing, the Law Department respectfully submits that there is probable cause to hold respondents Carlos Romualdez and Erlinda Romualdez for trial in violation of Section 10(g) and (j) in relation to Section 45(j) of Republic Act No. 8189. There is no doubt that they applied for registration as new voters of Burauen, Leyte consciously, freely and voluntarily. [56] We take occasion to reiterate that the Constitution grants to the COMELEC the power to prosecute cases or violations of election laws. Article IX (C), Section 2 (6) of the 1987 Constitution, provides: (6) File, upon a verified complaint, or on its own initiative, petitions in court for inclusion or exclusion of voters; investigate and where appropriate, prosecute cases or violations of election laws, including acts or omissions constituting election frauds, offenses, and malpractices. This power to prosecute necessarily involves the power to determine who shall be prosecuted, and the corollary right to decide whom not to prosecute. [57] Evidently, must this power to prosecute also include the right to determine under which laws prosecution will be pursued. The courts cannot dictate the prosecution nor usurp its discretionary powers. As a rule, courts cannot interfere with the prosecutor's discretion and control of the criminal prosecution. [58] Its rationale cannot be doubted. For the business of a court of justice is to be an impartial tribunal, and not to get involved with the success or failure of the prosecution to prosecute. [59] Every now and then, the prosecution may err in the selection of its strategies, but such errors are not for neutral courts to rectify, any more than courts should correct the blunders of the defense. [60] Fourth . In People v. Delgado , [61] this Court said that when the COMELEC, through its duly authorized law officer, conducts the preliminary investigation of an election offense and upon a prima facie finding of a probable cause, files the Information in the proper court, said court thereby acquires jurisdiction over the case. Consequently, all the subsequent disposition of said case must be subject to the approval of the court. The records show that Informations charging petitioners with violation of Section 10(g) and (j), in relation to Section 45(j) of Republic Act No. 8189 had been filed with the RTC. The case must, thus, be allowed to take its due course. It may be recalled that petitioners prayed for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order or Writ of Preliminary Injunction before this Court to restrain the COMELEC from executing its Resolutions of 11 June 2004 and 27 January 2005. In a Resolution dated 20 June 2006, this Court En Banc denied for lack of merit petitioners' Motion Reiterating Prayer for Issuance of Writ of Preliminary Injunction and to Cite for Indirect Contempt. Logically, the normal course of trial is expected to have continued in the proceedings a quo. WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The assailed Resolutions, dated 11 June 2004 and 27 January 2005 of the COMELEC En Banc are AFFIRMED. Costs against petitioners. SO ORDERED .

The presence of the former name in the book of voters or certified list of voters in precincts other than where he is duly registered shall not be an excuse hereof; i) The posting of a list of voters outside or at the door of a precinct on the day of an election, plebiscite, referendum, initiative and/or recall and which list is different in contents from the certified list of voters being used by the Board of Election Inspectors; and j) Violation of any of the provisions of this Act.

DISSENTING OPINION Tinga, J.: This case presented itself with an alluring promise the rare opportunity to declare a penal provision unconstitutional and void for vagueness, in the process obliterating the impression, spawned by recent pronouncements of the Court based on an erroneous reading of applicable American jurisprudence, that such a denouement would not unfold in this jurisdiction. Quite lamentably, the majority prevented the promise from blossoming to fruition, perpetuating instead a grievous doctrinal error which is already the subject of strenuous criticism within the legal academe. [1] A vague criminal statute at its core violates due process, as it deprives fair notice and standards to all - the citizens, the law enforcement officers, prosecutors and judges. The petition in this case has allowed the Court to engage in as thorough inquiry as there ever has been on the constitutional right to due process, to infuse vitality and sophistication in the litigation of such primordial right. Yet, in the end, instead of reinforcing a perspective more attuned to the fullest measure of the people's democratic rights, the Court has chosen not to rise to the challenge. The petition should have been granted. The assailed Resolution of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) directs the filing of criminal informations against petitioners Carlos and Erlinda Romualdez for violation of Section 10 (g) and (j) of Republic Act No. 8189 (Rep. Act 8189), also known as the Voter's Registration Act, in relation to Section 45(j) of the same law. It is Section 45(j) which criminalizes the violation of Section 10, as well as the violation of any and all other provisions of Rep. Act 8189, as an election offense. Yet in the final analysis, Section 45(j) is unconstitutional, violative as it is of the due process clause, and thus should be voided. I. The case stemmed from a complaint [2] dated 12 July 2000 filed with the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) Law Department by private respondents Dennis Garay and Angelino Apostol [3] against petitioners, spouses Carlos and Erlinda Romualdez. The complaint alleged that petitioners violated Sections 261(y)(2) and 261(y)(5) of the Omnibus Election Code, and Section 12(3) of Republic Act No. 8189 (Rep. Act 8189), also known as the Voter's Registration Act, such violations arising from the acts initiated by petitioners in registering as voters in Burauen, Leyte. Petitioners had applied for registration as new voters with the Office of the Election Officer in Burauen on 9 and 11 May 2000, respectively. In their respective applications, petitioners stated that they were residents of 935 San Jose St., in Burauen. They left blank the space in the application form requiring them to state the years and months of their ""period of residence"" in the aforementioned municipality. [4] The complaint alleged that in truth petitioners were actually residents of 113 Mariposa Loop, Mariposa St., Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, Quezon City, as well as registered voters in Precinct No. 4419-A of Barangay Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, District IV, in Quezon City. To support this factual allegation, were various certifications issued by barangay and election officers of Quezon City, [5] as well as the Quezon City Voter Registration Records of the petitioners were attached to the complaint. [6] The complaint further stated that oppositions had been filed against petitioners' application for registration in Burauen. In response thereto, petitioners filed with the Office of the Election Officer in Burauen various documents evincing not only their intent to transfer their registration as voters from Quezon City to Burauen, which was their new place of residence, but the actuality that they had began to formalize such transfer pursuant to Section 12 of Rep. Act No. 8189. Particularly, said documents include letters from petitioners to the election officer of Burauen manifesting their intent to transfer their registrations, as well as their respective Affidavits of Transfer of Voter's Registration under Section 12, Rep. Act 8189. Petitioners also explained that by reason of honest mistake, they had erroneously filed applications as new voters in Burauen, instead of as transferee voters. The complaint likewise point out the particular provisions of law for which petitioners could be held accountable. Section 261(y)(2) and (y)(5) of the Omnibus Election Code respectively penalizes knowingly making any false or untruthful statements relative to any data or information required in the application for registration, and the re-registration anew by a previously registered voter without the filing of an application for cancellation of his previous registration. On the other hand, the failure to apply for transfer of registration records due to change of residence to another city or municipality was alleged to be in violation of Section 12 of Rep. Act No. 8189. The matter was referred to the Commission on Elections and docketed as E.O. Case No. 2000-36. Petitioners filed a Joint Counter-Affidavit with Motion to Dismiss. They alleged that they had been intending to reside in Burauen since 1989, and they actually took up residence therein on 9 May 2000. They claimed having left unanswered the blank space for ""period of residence"" in their application for registration because they were unsure what period of residence was being required. [7] They also averred that as early as 18 April 2000, they had already written the election officer in Quezon City requesting the cancellation of their registration as voters in Barangay Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, but the Assistant Quezon City Election Officer had refused to acknowledge receipt of the same on the ground that the proper procedure was to file a request for transfer of voter's registration records with the election officer of Burauen. Petitioners noted that they did file an Application for Transfer of Registration Records in Burauen, and that the same was approved. Finally, they claimed that the filing of the case was politically motivated as petitioner Carlos Romualdez was a candidate for Congress in the second district of Leyte in the 2001 elections. On 28 November 2003, the designated Investigating Officer assigned to hear the case, Atty. Maria Norina Tangaro-Casingal, issued a resolution recommending the prosecution of petitioners for the commission of an election offense, i.e. , violation of Section 10(g) and (j) in relation to Section 45(j) of Rep. Act No. 8189. This recommendation was adopted by the COMELEC en banc in a Resolution [8] dated 3 February 2004. Section 10 of Rep. Act No. 8189 states in part: Sec. 10. Registration of Voters.-- A qualified voter shall be registered in the permanent list of voters in a precinct of the city or municipality wherein he resides to be able to vote in any election. To register as a voter, he shall personally accomplish an application form for registration as prescribed by the Commission in three (3) copies before the Election Officer on any date during office hours after having acquired the qualifications of a voter. The application shall contain the following data: (a) Name, surname, middle name, and/or maternal surname; (b) Sex; (c) Date, and place of birth; (d) Citizenship; (e) Civil status, if married, name of spouse; (f) Profession, occupation or work; (g) Periods of residence in the Philippines and in the place of registration; (h) Exact address with the name of the street and house number for location in the precinct maps maintained by the local office of the Commission, or in case there is none, a brief description of his residence, sitio, and barangay; (i) A statement that the applicant possesses all the qualifications of a voter; (j) A statement that the applicant is not a registered voter of any precinct; and (k) Such information or data as may be required by the Commission. xxx The COMELEC observed that a violation of Section 10 of Rep. Act No. 8189 is an election offense, pursuant to Section 45(j) of the same law, which reads: Sec. 45. Election Offenses. - The following shall be considered election offenses under this Act: x x x x (j) Violation of the provisions of this Act. The COMELEC found that petitioners violated Section 10 of Rep. Act No. 8189 in two ways. First, petitioners had stated under oath that they were not registered voters in any other precinct, when in fact, the records showed that they still were registered voters of Precinct No. 4419-A in Barangay Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, District IV, Quezon City, at the time they executed their application. The COMELEC pointed out that Section 12 of the same law provided for the procedure to be observed in cases of transfer of residence to another city/municipality, which involved an application for transfer of registration with the Election Officer of the new place of residence. Even though petitioners subsequently filed an application for transfer pursuant to Section 12, manifesting therein that they had erroneously filed an application as a new voter by reason of honest mistake, the COMELEC pointed out that a statutory offense such as the violation of election law is "" mala prohibita "" and that good faith, ignorance or lack of malice was ""beside the point"" in such cases. Second, the COMELEC also stated that petitioners' failure to fill up the blank portion of their application on ""period of residence"" likewise constituted a violation of Section 10(g), which specifies that the applicant state the periods of residence in the Philippines and in the places of registration. A motion for reconsideration filed by petitioners was denied by the COMELEC through a Resolution dated 27 January 2005. [9] As a result, the present petition was filed. While the petition was pending with this Court, two separate Informations dated 12 January 2006 were filed against each of the petitioners by the COMELEC with the Regional Trial Court of Burauen, and corresponding Orders of Arrest were issued by the trial court judge. Petitioners allege before us that the COMELEC Resolution violates their constitutional right to due process, as well as their constitutional rights under Section 14(1) and (2), Article III of the Constitution. In that regard, they point out that while the complaint alleged violations of Sections 261(y)(2) and (5) of the Omnibus Election Code and Section 12 of Rep. Act 8189, they were charged instead with violation of different provisions of law altogether. Petitioners likewise argue that Section 45(j) of Rep. Act 8189 is ""vague"", as ""it does not specifically refer to a definite provision of law the violation of which would constitute an election offense."" The provision is thus ""not the `fair notice' required by the Constitution for provisions of this Act."" Section 45(j) is vague. It does not provide ""fair notice"" to the citizenry and the standards for enforcement and adjudication. In precise legal terms, I submit that Section 45(j) violates the due process clause of the Constitution, and should accordingly be nullified. II. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law. The due process clause makes legally operative our democratic rights, as it establishes freedom and free will as the normative human conditions which the State is bound to respect. Any legislated restrictions imposed by the State on life, liberty or property must be in accordance with due process of law. The scope of ""due process,"" as we currently understand it, is admittedly ambitious, but in its elemental form, it encompasses aboriginal values ascribed to justice such as equity, prudence, humaneness and fairness. Section 45(j) is vague. It does not provides ""fair notice"" to the citizentry, as well as the standards for enforcement and adjudication. Thus, the section violates the due process clause and thus deserves to be struck down. The potency of the due process clause has depended on judicial refinement, to allow for the crystallization of its abstract ideals into a set of standards, from which a deliberate determination can be had whether the provision bears operative effect following a given set of facts. As a result, various subsets to due process have emerged, including the distinction between procedural due process and substantive due process. Stated very generally, substantive due process guarantees against the arbitrary exercise of state power, while procedural due process is a guarantee of procedural fairness. [10] Substantive and procedural due process are equally sacrosanct in the constitutional order, and a law that is infirm in either regard is wholly infirm. Among the components of due process, particularly concerning penal statutes, is the fair notice requirement. The Court, through Justice Sarmiento, acknowledged in People v. Nazario [11] that a statute violates due process, and thus repugnant to the Constitution, if it fails ""to accord persons, especially the parties targeted by it, fair notice of the conduct to avoid."" [12] Such flaw is one characteristic of a vague statute, the other being that ""it leaves law enforcers unbridled discretion in carrying out its provisions and becomes an arbitrary flexing of the Government muscle."" [13] Both attributes earmark a statute as ""vague"", the generally accepted definition of a vague statute being one that lacks comprehensible standards that people ""of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application."" [14] Even though the ""fair notice"" rule is integral to due process itself, it finds realization in still another provision of our Bill of Rights. Section 14(2), Article III [15] assures that an accused is ""to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him."" Both Justice Cruz and Fr. Bernas acknowledge that this constitutional right extends not only to the criminal information against the accused, but also to the language of the statute under which prosecution is pursued. [16] Yet our own jurisprudence has yet to expressly link the fair notice requirement with Section 14(2), Article III, [17] though this need not be a contestable point since the due process clause under Section 1, Article III already embodies the fair notice requirement. As earlier stated, a penal statute that violates the fair notice requirement is marked by vagueness because it leaves its subjects to necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. What has emerged as the most contentious issue in the deliberations over this petition is whether such vagueness may lead to the nullification of a penal law. Our 2004 ruling in Romualdez v. Sandiganbayan [18] states: ""It is best to stress at the outset that the overbreadth and the vagueness doctrines have special application only to free-speech cases. They are not appropriate for testing the validity of penal statutes."" [19] The time has come to reconsider that statement. Rooted in unyielding formalism and deprived of guidance from basic constitutional tenets, that dicta disenchants the rights of free people, diminishing as it does, the basic right to due process. III A deeper analysis of the vagueness doctrine is in order. Employing the terminology preferred by Collings, the vagueness doctrine is a specie of ""unconstitutional uncertainty,"" which may involve ""procedural due process uncertainty cases"" and ""substantive due process uncertainty cases."" [20] ""Procedural due process uncertainty"" involves cases where the statutory language was so obscure that it failed to give adequate warning to those subject to its prohibitions as well as to provide proper standards for adjudication. [21] Such a definition encompasses the vagueness doctrine. [22] This perspective rightly integrates the vagueness doctrine with the due process clause, a necessary interrelation since there is no constitutional provision that explicitly bars statutes that are ""void-for-vagueness."" Void-for-vagueness derives from the basic tenet of criminal law that conduct may not be treated as criminal unless it has been so defined by an authority having the institutional competence to do so before it has taken place. It requires that a legislative crime definition be meaningfully precise. [23] The inquiry into whether a criminal statute is ""meaningfully precise"" requires the affirmative satisfaction of two criteria. First, does the statute fairly give notice to those it seeks to bind of its strictures? Second, is the statute precise enough that it does not invite arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by law enforcement authorities? Unless both criteria are satisfied, the statute is void for vagueness. There are three concerns animating the vagueness doctrine. First, courts are rightly concerned that citizens be fairly warned of what behavior is being outlawed; second, courts are concerned because vague laws provide opportunities for arbitrary enforcement and put the enforcement decisions in the hands of police officers and prosecutors instead of legislatures; finally, where vague statutes regulate behavior that is even close to constitutionally protected, courts fear a chilling effect will impinge on constitutional rights. [24] These three interests have been deemed by the U.S. Supreme Court as important enough to justify total invalidation of a statute, [25] such invalidation warranted unless there is some intervening act that has eliminated the threat to those interests. [26] In its essence, the vagueness doctrine is a critical implement to the fundamental role of the courts to rule justly and fairly. [27] Uncertainty in statutes enables persons to be penalized for acts which are not precisely defined in law as criminal, or for acts which are constitutionally protected but cast within an overbroad definition of a crime. Our special focus now lies with the ""void-for-vagueness"" or ""procedural due process uncertainty"" rule. Two coordinate functions are served by the doctrine: guidance to the individual in planning his future conduct, and guidance to those adjudicating his rights and duties. [28] It is clear that some substantial degree of definiteness should be required of penal statutes, for if a person is to be charged with knowledge of all his rights and duties under a statute regardless of whether he has read or understood it, fundamental fairness requires that he be given at least the opportunity to discover its existence, its applicability, and its meaning. While the due process requirements of publication are designed to fill the first of those needs, the due process requirements of definiteness are designed to fill the latter two. [29] The requirement of certainty arose from a fundamental common-law concept, a matter of fairness, and an element of due process of law. [30] No one will deny that a criminal statute should be definite enough to give notice of required conduct to those who would avoid its penalties, and to guide the judge in its application and the attorney defending those charged with its violation. [31] The rules must be definite enough to enable the judge to make rulings of law which are so closely referable to the statute as to assure consistency of application. [32] In addition, the statute must serve the individual as a guide to his future conduct, and it is said to be too indefinite if ""men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application."" [33] If the statute does not provide adequate standards for adjudication, by which guilt or innocence may be determined, it will be struck down. [34] The danger of a statute that suffers from the vagueness defect cannot be underestimated. Taken to the extreme, the absence of any clear and definite standards for conviction would leave the matter of freedom of the accused solely upon the discretion of the judge, to whom the language of the statute would offer no guide to adjudication. At worse, it could represent ""the coercive force of society run loose at the whim of the [prosecutor] without adequate restraint at the level of the trial court (for want of standards by which to restrain), enforced against indigent and unrepresented defendants."" [35] Indeed, the chances for acquittal as against a vague statute are significantly bettered depending on the skill of the defense counsel, and the poorer an accused is, the slimmer the chances that a skilled counsel would be within means. Void-for-vagueness statutes strike special impunity at the impoverished. They smack of unmitigated heedlessness of the lot of the likely victims of their built-in uncertainty, especially the underprivileged. Romualdez , [36] cited by the ponencia , is unfortunately insensate to these constitutional concerns. That decision referenced Estrada v. Desierto [37] as basis for its response to the vagueness challenge. The ponencia in Estrada did adopt and incorporate the views stated by Justice Mendoza in his Separate Opinion, particularly, that ""[t]he overbreadth and vagueness doctrines then have special application only to free speech cases...[t]hey are inapt for testing the validity of penal statutes... the doctrines of strict scrutiny, overbreadth, and vagueness are analytical tools developed for testing `on their faces' statutes in free speech cases or, as they are called in American law, First Amendment cases. [t]hey cannot be made to do service when what is involved is a criminal statute."" [38] However, in his Separate Opinion to the Resolution (on the Motion for Reconsideration) dated 29 January 2002, Justice Mendoza acknowledged: [L]et it be clearly stated that, when we said that `the doctrines of strict scrutiny, overbreadth and vagueness are analytical tools for testing `on their faces' statutes in free speech cases or, as they are called in American law, First Amendment cases [and therefore] cannot be made to do service when what is involved is a criminal statute,' we did not mean to suggest that the doctrines do not apply to criminal statutes at all. They do although they do not justify a facial challenge, but only an as-applied challenge, to those statutes... Neither did we mean to suggest that the doctrines justify facial challenges only in free speech or First Amendment cases. To be sure, they also justify facial challenges in cases under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution with respect to so-called `fundamental rights'... "" [39] In light of Justice Mendoza's subsequent clarification, it is a disputable matter whether Estrada established a doctrine that ""void-for-vagueness or overbreadth challenges do not apply to penal statutes,"" the reference thereto in Romualdez notwithstanding. However, there is no doubt that Romualdez itself, which did not admit to a similar qualification or clarification, set forth a ""doctrine"" that ""the overbreadth and the vagueness doctrines have special application only to free-speech cases [and] are not appropriate for testing the validity of penal statutes."" As a result, the Office of the Solicitor General invokes Romualdez in its present Memorandum before the Court, and the petitioners in at least one other case now pending before this Court urges the reexamination of that doctrine. The ponente has also cited in tandem with the Romualdez precedent this Separate Opinion of Justice Mendoza for the purpose of denominating the key issue as whether the vagueness doctrine can be utilized as an analytical tool to challenge the statute ""on-its-face"" or ""as applied."" Unfortunately, we can only engage that question if we acknowledge in the first place that the doctrine of vagueness can be applied to criminal statutes, because if not (as pronounced in Romualdez ), there is no point in distinguishing between on-its-face and as-applied challenges. Moreover, this subsequent Separate Opinion, especially as it may distinguish from Justice Mendoza's earlier and more sweeping Separate Opinion, cannot be asserted as reflective of a doctrine announced by this Court. What works towards such effect is Romualdez , which again does not offer such clarificatory distinction, and which certainly does not concede, as Justice Mendoza eventually did, that ""we did not mean to suggest that the doctrines [of void-for-vagueness] do not apply to criminal statutes at all"" and that ""neither did we mean that that doctrines do not justify facial challenges ""in cases under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution with respect to the so-called `fundamental rights.'"" What we have thus seen is the queer instance of obiter in a latter case, Romualdez v. Sandiganbayan , making a doctrine of an obiter in an earlier case, Estrada v. Desierto . Moreover, the controversial statement in Romualdez , as adopted from Estrada with respect to the vagueness challenge being applicable only to free speech cases, is simply not reflective of the American jurisprudential rule which birthed the vagueness doctrine in the first place. The leading American case laying down the rules for the vagueness challenge is Connally v. General Construction Co., [40] decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1926. It concerned a statute creating an eight (8)-hour workday in Oklahoma, through a provision which read: 'That not less than the current rate of per diem wages in the locality where the work is performed shall be paid to laborers, workmen, mechanics, prison guards, janitors in public institutions, or other persons so employed by or on behalf of the state, ... and laborers, workmen, mechanics, or other persons employed by contractors or subcontractors in the execution of any contract or contracts with the state, ... shall be deemed to be employed by or on behalf of the state. ...' (388) [41] The statute further penalized violations thereof with a fine. A constitutional challenge to this statute was raised that the statutory provisions, ""if enforced, will deprive plaintiff, its officers, agents and representatives, of their liberty and property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution; that they contain no ascertainable standard of guilt; that it cannot be determined with any degree of certainty what sum constitutes a current wage in any locality; and that the term 'locality' itself is fatally vague and uncertain."" The U.S. Supreme Court agreed, holding: That the terms of a penal statute creating a new offense must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties is a well- recognized requirement, consonant alike with ordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law ; and a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law. xxx [42] The dividing line between what is lawful and unlawful cannot be left to conjecture. The citizen cannot be held to answer charges based upon penal statutes whose mandates are so uncertain that they will reasonably admit of different constructions. A criminal statute cannot rest upon an uncertain foundation. The crime, and the elements constituting it, must be so clearly expressed that the ordinary person can intelligently choose, in advance, what course it is lawful for him to pursue. Penal statutes prohibiting the doing of certain things, and providing a punishment for their violation, should not admit of such a double meaning that the citizen may act upon the one conception of its requirements and the courts upon another.' We are of opinion that this provision presents a double uncertainty, fatal to its validity as a criminal statute. In the first place, the words 'current rate of wages' do not denote a specific or definite sum, but minimum, maximum, and intermediate amounts, indeterminately, varying from time to time and dependent upon the class and kind of work done, the efficiency of the workmen, etc., as the bill alleges is the case in respect of the territory surrounding the bridges under construction. The statutory phrase reasonably cannot be confined to any of these amounts, since it imports each and all of them. The current rate of wages' is not simple, but progressive-from so much (the minimum) to so much (the maximum), including all between; and to direct the payment of an amount which shall not be less than one of several different amounts, without saying which, is to leave the question of what is meant incapable of any definite answer. See People ex rel. Rodgers v. Coler, 166 N. Y. 1, 24-25, 59 N. E. 716, 52 L. R. A. 814, 82 Am. St. Rep. 605. Nor can the question be solved by resort to the established canons of construction that enable a court to look through awkward or clumsy expression, or language wanting in precision, to the intent of the Legislature. For the vice of the statute here lies in the impossibility of ascertaining, by any reasonable test, that the Legislature meant one thing rather than another, and in the futility of an attempt to apply a requirement, which assumes the existence of a rate of wages single in amount, to a rate in fact composed of a multitude of gradations. To construe the phrase 'current rate of wages' as meaning either the lowest rate or the highest rate, or any intermediate rate, or, if it were possible to determine the various factors to be considered, an average of all rates, would be as likely to defeat the purpose of the Legislature as to promote it. See State v. Partlow, 91 N. C. 550, 553, 49 Am. Rep. 652; Commonwealth v. Bank of Pennsylvania, 3 Watts S. (Pa.) 173, 177. In the second place, additional obscurity is imparted to the statute by the use of the qualifying word 'locality.' Who can say, with any degree of accuracy, what areas constitute the locality where a given piece of work is being done? Two men, moving in any direction from the place of operations, would not be at all likely to agree upon the point where they had passed the boundary which separated the locality of that work from the next locality. It is said that this question is settled for us by the decision of the state Supreme Court on rehearing in State v. Tibbetts, 205 P. 776, 779. But all the court did there was to define the word 'locality' as meaning 'place,' 'near the place,' 'vicinity,' or 'neighborhood.' Accepting this as correct, as of course we do, the result is not to remove the obscurity, but rather to offer a choice of uncertainties. The word 'neighborhood' is quite as susceptible of variation as the word 'locality.' Both terms are elastic and, dependent upon circumstances, may be equally satisfied by areas measured by rods or by miles. See Schmidt v. Kansas City Distilling Co., 90 Mo. 284, 296, 1 S. W. 865, 2 S. W. 417, 59 Am. Rep. 16; Woods v. Cochrane and Smith, 38 Iowa, 484, 485; State ex rel. Christie v. Meek, 26 Wash. 405, 407-408, 67 P. 76; Millville Imp. Co. v. Pitman, etc., Gas Co., 75 N. J. Law, 410, 412, 67 A. 1005; Thomas v. Marshfield, 10 Pick. (Mass.) 364, 367. The case last cited held that a grant of common to the inhabitants of a certain neighborhood was void because the term 'neighborhood' was not sufficiently certain to identify the grantees. In other connections or under other conditions the term 'locality' might be definite enough, but not so in a statute such as that under review imposing criminal penalties. Certainly, the expression 'near the place' leaves much to be desired in the way of a delimitation of boundaries; for it at once provokes the inquiry, 'How near?' And this element of uncertainty cannot here be put aside as of no consequence, for, as the rate of wages may vary-as in the present case it is alleged it does vary- among different employers and according to the relative efficiency of the workmen, so it may vary in different sections. The result is that the application of the law depends, not upon a word of fixed meaning in itself, or one made definite by statutory or judicial definition, or by the context or other legitimate aid to its construction, but upon the probably varying impressions of juries as to whether given areas are or are not to be included within particular localities. The constitutional guaranty of due process cannot be allowed to rest upon a support so equivocal. [43] The statute in question did not involve a proscription on free speech, but a standard of wages with a corresponding financial penalty for violation thereof. Without any consideration to the notion that the ""void-for-vagueness"" challenge should be limited to free speech cases, the U.S. High Court accepted the notion that a vague statute could be invalidated and then proceeded to analyze whether the statute was indeed vague. The fact that the statute was invalidated makes it clear then that the ""void-for-vagueness"" challenge could be employed against a penal statute. Within the next 73 years, the U.S. Supreme Court repeatedly invalidated penal statutes on the ground of ""void-for-vagueness,"" [44] in the cases of Cline v. Frink Dairy Co. , [45] Lanzetta v. State of New Jersey , [46] Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville , [47] Grayned v. City of Rockford [48] , Smith v. Goguen [49] and Kolender v. Lawson. [50] More recently, in 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court reiterated the rule in City of Chicago v. Morales [51] as it invalidated an anti-loitering ordinance. The decision explained the ordinance as follows: The ordinance creates a criminal offense punishable by a fine of up to $500, imprisonment for not more than six months, and a requirement to perform up to 120 hours of community service. Commission of the offense involves four predicates. First, the police officer must reasonably believe that at least one of the two or more persons present in a public place is a criminal street gang membe[r]. Second, the persons must be loitering, which the ordinance defines as remain[ing] in any one place with no apparent purpose. Third, the officer must then order all of the persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area. Fourth, a person must disobey the officer's order. If any person, whether a gang member or not, disobeys the officer's order, that person is guilty of violating the ordinance. [52] In explaining why the ordinance suffered from the ""void-for-vagueness"" defect, the U.S. Supreme Court, through Senior Associate Justice John Paul Stevens, first attacked the statutory definition of ""loitering:"" xxx The Illinois Supreme Court recognized that the term loiter may have a common and accepted meaning, 177 Ill. 2d, at 451, 687 N. E. 2d, at 61, but the definition of that term in this ordinance--to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose --does not. It is difficult to imagine how any citizen of the city of Chicago standing in a public place with a group of people would know if he or she had an apparent purpose. If she were talking to another person, would she have an apparent purpose? If she were frequently checking her watch and looking expectantly down the street, would she have an apparent purpose? Since the city cannot conceivably have meant to criminalize each instance a citizen stands in public with a gang member, the vagueness that dooms this ordinance is not the product of uncertainty about the normal meaning of loitering, but rather about what loitering is covered by the ordinance and what is not. The Illinois Supreme Court emphasized the law's failure to distinguish between innocent conduct and conduct threatening harm. Its decision followed the precedent set by a number of state courts that have upheld ordinances that criminalize loitering combined with some other overt act or evidence of criminal intent. However, state courts have uniformly invalidated laws that do not join the term loitering with a second specific element of the crime. [53] Next, the U.S. Supreme Court explained the principle of ""fair notice"" that necessitated the ""void-for-vagueness"" rule: First, the purpose of the fair notice requirement is to enable the ordinary citizen to conform his or her conduct to the law. No one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939). Although it is true that a loiterer is not subject to criminal sanctions unless he or she disobeys a dispersal order, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit. If the loitering is in fact harmless and innocent, the dispersal order itself is an unjustified impairment of liberty. If the police are able to decide arbitrarily which members of the public they will order to disperse, then the Chicago ordinance becomes indistinguishable from the law we held invalid in Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham , an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, it cannot provide the kind of advance notice that will protect the putative loiterer from being ordered to disperse. Such an order cannot retroactively give adequate warning of the boundary between the permissible and the impermissible applications of the law. xxx Lack of clarity in the description of the loiterer's duty to obey a dispersal order might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear, but it does buttress our conclusion that the entire ordinance fails to give the ordinary citizen adequate notice of what is forbidden and what is permitted. The Constitution does not permit a legislature to set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at large. United States v. Reese , 92 U. S. 214, 221 (1876). This ordinance is therefore vague not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all. Coates v. Cincinnati , 402 U. S. 611, 614 (1971). [54] In her concurring opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor offered this succinct restatement of the void-for-vagueness rule: A penal law is void-for-vagueness if it fails to define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited or fails to establish guidelines to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law. Kolender v . Lawson , 461 U. S. 352, 357 (1983). Of these, the more important aspect of vagueness doctrine `is ... the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.' Id., at 358 (quoting Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 574-575 (1974)). I agree that some degree of police discretion is necessary to allow the police to perform their peacekeeping responsibilities satisfactorily. See post, at 12 (dissenting opinion). A criminal law, however, must not permit policemen, prosecutors, and juries to conduct a standardless sweep ... to pursue their personal predilections. Kolender v. Lawson , supra, at 358 (quoting Smith v. Goguen , supra, at 575). [55] Consider the lucid explanation of Gunther and Sullivan, which integrates the principles established by American jurisprudence on that point: The concept of vagueness under the [freedom of expression clause in the] First Amendment [of the U.S. Constitution] draws on the procedural due process requirement of adequate notice, under which a law must convey `sufficient definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices."" Jordan v. DeGeorge , 341 U.S. 223 (1951) A law will be void on its face for vagueness if persons ""of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application."" Connally v. General Construction Co ., 269 U.S. 385 (1926). One of the purposes of this requirement is to ensure fair notice to the defendant. But the ban on vagueness protect not only liberty, but also equality and the separation of executive from legislative power through the prevention of selective enforcement. See Smith v. Goguen (415 U.S. 566): ""We have recognized that the more important aspect of the vagueness doctrine is not actual notice, but the other principal element of the doctrine - the requirement that legislatures set reasonably clear guidelines for law enforcement officials and triers of fact in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement"". xxx [56] Prior to Romualdez , Philippine jurisprudence had recognized the susceptibility of penal statutes to the vagueness challenge, even if they did not pertain to the free exercise of speech. Nazario , earlier cited, was one such case. Another instance, was People v. Dela Piedra , [57] decided in 2001, where the Court announced: Due process requires that the terms of a penal statute must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its. penalties. A criminal statute that fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute, or is so indefinite that it encourages arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions, is void for vagueness. The constitutional vice in a vague or indefinite statute is the injustice to the accused in placing him on trial for an offense, the nature of which he is given no fair warning. [58] Dela Piedra is inconsistent with the subsequent Romualdez doctrine, yet it embodies the correct basic proposition which is sensitive to the fundamentals of the due process clause. There was, and still is, no good or logical reason for Philippine jurisprudence to adopt an opposing rule from that in American jurisprudence in relation to the void-for-vagueness doctrine. Is the doctrine that ""void-for-vagueness"" cannot invalidate penal statutes somehow more appropriate to the Filipino mindset than to the American way? I really could not see any reason to foster the contrary rule unless it is the intent to effectively moot in the Philippines the right of a Filipino accused to be informed of the nature of the accusation against him/her through a penal law that defines the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited or establishes guidelines to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law. IV. It is clear that a criminal statute may be nullified on the ground of void-for-vagueness. What are the requisites that must obtain before a suit predicated on such ground may be brought before the courts? Assuming that the suit successfully demonstrates the vagueness of the statute or provision of law, what remedy can the courts apply? There are orthodox precepts in Philippine law that may find application in the resolution of void-for-vagueness cases. Long established in our jurisprudence are the four requisites for judicial inquiry: an actual case or controversy; the question of constitutionality must be raised by the proper party; the constitutional question must be raised at the earliest possible opportunity; and the constitutional question must be necessary to the determination of the case itself. [59] These requisites would accommodate instances such as those in the present case, where the constitutional challenge to the penal law is raised by the very persons who are charged under the questioned statute or provision. On the premise that the statute in question contravenes the due process clause because it is vague, our jurisprudence likewise supplies the options for remedial measures which the Court can undertake. In essence, under Philippine jurisprudence, the courts possess a wide berth of discretion when confronted with a penal statute that is impermissibly vague. The general rule is that an unconstitutional act is not law; it confers no rights, imposes no duties, affords no protection, creates no office; it is, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed. [60] At the same time, there are doctrines in statutory construction that authorize the courts to allow the survival of the challenged statute or provision of law. It is a well-settled rule that a statute should be construed whenever possible in a manner that will avoid conflict with the Constitution. [61] Where a statute is reasonably susceptible of two constructions, one constitutional and the other unconstitutional, that construction in favor of its constitutionality shall be adopted while the construction that renders it invalid rejected. Yet in the United States, even as the U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized vague penal laws as contrary to the due process clause, [62] it has also recognized special considerations when the assailed statute also infringes on the First Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Grayned v. City of Rockford , [63] expresses thus: It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them . A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application. Third, but related, where a vague statute abut[s] upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of [those] freedoms . Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to `steer far wider of the unlawful zone' . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked. [64] One year after Grayned was decided in 1972, a divided U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in Broadrick v. Oklahoma , [65] a ruling that would have significant impact in the analysis of First Amendment cases. Significantly, Broadrick was the main case cited by Justice Mendoza in his Separate Opinion in Estrada v. Sandiganbayan in support of his assertion that ""[t]he overbreadth and vagueness doctrines then have special application only to free speech cases."" [66] To understand Broadrick , it should be noted that under U.S. jurisprudence, the general rule is that ""an individual has no standing to litigate the rights of third persons."" [67] Another traditional rule is the ""as applied"" mode of judicial review which ""tests the constitutionality of legislation as it is applied to particular facts on a case-by-case basis."" [68] Both these traditional rules found an exception in the overbreadth doctrine, which is animated by the principle that ""a government purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms."" [69] Particularly in regard to First Amendment cases, overbreadth carved exceptions to the traditional rules of constitutional litigation. ""First, it results in the invalidation of a law `on its face' rather than `as applied' to a particular speaker."" [70] ""Second, overbreadth is an exception to the usual rules on standing xxx challengers are in effect permitted to raise the rights of third parties."" [71] In Broadrick , the U.S. Supreme Court found the opportunity to limit the application of the overbreadth doctrine. But the constitutional challenge made therein was not limited to overbreadth for question of vagueness was also raised against a state law restricting the partisan political activities of Oklahoma state employees. In dealing with the vagueness aspect, the majority opinion concluded that the challenged provisions were not impermissibly vague, applying the standard test set forth in cases such as Grayned . Whatever other problems there are with 818, it is all but frivolous to suggest that the section fails to give adequate warning of what activities it proscribes or fails to set out explicit standards for those who must apply it. Grayned v. City of Rockford , supra, at 108. In the plainest language, it prohibits any state classified employee from being an officer or member of a partisan political club or a candidate for any paid public office. It forbids solicitation of contributions for any political organization, candidacy or other political purpose and taking part in the management or affairs of any political party or in any political campaign. Words inevitably contain germs of uncertainty and, as with the Hatch Act, there may be disputes over the meaning of such terms in 818 as partisan, or take part in, or affairs of political parties. But what was said in Letter Carriers, ante, at 578-579, is applicable here: there are limitations in the English language with respect to being both specific and manageably brief, and it seems to us that although the prohibitions may not satisfy those intent on finding fault at any cost, they are set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with, without sacrifice to the public interest. [72] However, in ruling on the claim of overbreadth, Broadrick did not utilize any previously established test or standard, but instead pronounced a new standard of ""substantial overbreadth"", otherwise known as ""strong medicine"". [73] It is clear that the Court in Broadrick still recognized the distinction between vagueness and overbreadth, and resolved those two questions separately. Nonetheless, as is manifest in Justice Mendoza's Separate Opinion in Estrada , the impression is that the same doctrines apply to both vagueness and overbreadth, notwithstanding Broadrick . Why is that so? As earlier explained, a vague penal statute is constitutionally offensive because it fails to give fair notice to those subjected to the regulation as to what conduct is precisely proscribed. On the other hand, a statute that suffers from overbreadth is one drawn so broadly, as it penalizes protected speech or behavior as well as such acts within the right of the State to prohibit. Thus, a statute that prohibits ""the commission of illegal acts within state universities"" is arguably vague, as it does not sufficiently define what exactly constitutes ""illegal acts"". On the other hand, a statute that proscribes ""the commission of acts within state universities that help promote rebellion"" is arguably overbroad. Such a statute may encompass not only those acts of rebellion within the ambit of the State to penalize, but also legitimate political expressions or criticisms of the State which are fundamentally guaranteed under the free expression clause. Another material distinction. In the case of overbroad statutes, it is necessary to inquire into the potential applications of the legislation in order to determine whether it can be unconstitutionally applied. [74] In contrast, the constitutional flaws attached to a vague statute are evident on its face, as the textual language in itself is insufficient in defining the proscribed conduct. Broadrick had alluded to the problems concerning legal standing with respect to overbreadth cases. Because the area involved was the First Amendment, litigants had traditionally been ""permitted to challenge a statute not because their own right of free expression are violated, but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute's very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression."" [75] Yet such expansive standing was problematic for the majority in Broadrick . The consequence of our departure from traditional rules of standing in the First Amendment area is that any enforcement of a statute thus placed at issue is totally forbidden until and unless a limiting construction or partial invalidation so narrows it as to remove the seeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression. Application of the overbreadth doctrine in this manner is, manifestly, strong medicine. [76] Thus, as a means of regulating standing in overbreadth cases, the U.S. Supreme Court announced in Broadrick : [F]acial overbreadth adjudication is an exception to our traditional rules of practice and that its function, a limited one at the outset, attenuates as the otherwise unprotected behavior that it forbids the State to sanction moves from pure speech toward conduct and that conduct - even if expressive - falls within the scope of otherwise valid criminal laws that reflect legitimate state interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct. Although such laws, if too broadly worded, may deter protected speech to some unknown extent, there comes a point where that effect - at best a prediction - cannot, with confidence, justify invalidating a statute on its face and so prohibiting a State from enforcing the statute against conduct that is admittedly within its power to proscribe. xxx To put the matter another way, particularly where conduct and not merely speech is involved, we believe that the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep. It is our view that 818 is not substantially overbroad and that whatever overbreadth may exist should be cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which its sanctions, assertedly, may not be applied. Broadrick jointly addressed the two concerns with respect to overbreadth cases - standing and the facial invalidation of statutes. It conceded that a successful overbreadth challenge necessitated the facial invalidation of the statute, a remedy characterized as ""strong medicine"". In order to limit the application of such ""strong medicine"", the U.S. Supreme Court declared that ""the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep."" [77] Do the same concerns on the overbreadth doctrine that informed Broadrick extend as well to vagueness? It must be recognized that the problem of overbreadth has no integral relation to procedural due process, which is the fundamental constitutional problem brought forth by vagueness. Moreover, the overbreadth doctrine developed amidst concerns over restrictions on First Amendment rights and can be said was formulated to bolster the guarantee of free expression. It is not as clear that the same degree of concern over the right of free expression was key to the development of the vagueness doctrine, which after all, primarily offended a different constitutional value. Since First Amendment values were at stake, the U.S. Supreme Court, prior to Broadrick , had found it necessary to relax the rules on standing with respect to overbreadth cases, a development which the subsequent Broadrick Court found disconcerting enough as to reverse direction. Yet contrary to the insinuation in Justice Mendoza's Estrada opinion, Broadrick should not bar challenges to vague penal statutes brought forth by those sought to be penalized under the assailed law. The restrictions on standing brought forth in Broadrick have no material relation to the legitimate concerns of a defendant who is being prosecuted under a law that defies the fair notice requirement under the due process clause. A brief note, at this juncture. Justice Carpio offers his own analysis of ""facial challenge"" and ""as-applied"" challenge. His submission discusses both concepts from the perspective of standing, contending that the present suit cannot be considered as a ""facial challenge"", or a challenge against the constitutionality of a statute that is filed where the petitioner claims no actual violation of his own rights under the assailed statute, but relies instead on the potential violation of his or other persons' rights. Instead, according to Justice Carpio, the present suit may be considered as an ""as-applied"" challenge, the traditional approach where the petitioner raises the violation of his constitutional rights irrespective of the constitutional grounds cited. I have no dispute with the characterization of the present suit as an ""as-applied"" challenge, as well as the statement that third-party standing to assail the constitutionality of statutes is impermissible as a general rule. Said positions can be accommodated following our traditional rules of standing in constitutional cases, even if these rules hardly employ the terms ""facial challenge"" or ""as-applied challenge."" The difficulty with the submission's preferred terms is that in United States jurisprudence, a ""facial challenge"" pertains not only to third-party standing in constitutional cases, but also the ""facial invalidation"" of statutes. This matter is problematic if we are to consider the holding of the U.S. Supreme Court in U.S. v. Salerno , [78] penned by the conservative Chief Justice Rehnquist. In 1987, a divided U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the ""facial challenge"" is ""the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid. [79] This characterization differs greatly from Justice Carpio's analysis that ""facial challenge"" only pertains to standing. Salerno has given rise to another implication to the ""facial challenge"" under American jurisprudence - that the nullification of a statute will be justified only if it is established that under no set of circumstances would the law remain valid. Interestingly, the Separate Opinion of Justice Mendoza in Estrada also favorably cites Salerno and the above-quoted declaration therein, a citation that adds to the confusion. Yet by simply distinguishing ""facial challenge"" (standing) from ""facial invalidation"" (adjudication on the merits), we can easily divorce this holding in Salerno from the aspect of standing, since there is no material relationship between the question of standing and the quoted-pronouncement in Salerno . Evidently, if we are to accept the Salerno proposition, and declare that the ""facial invalidation"" is warranted only upon demonstration that under no set of circumstances will the challenged provision be constitutional, such a doctrine would stand as the Everest of judicial review. It would, among others, consequence in the affirmation of Section 45(j). But should we accept the Salerno proposition? Tellingly, the declaration has not been met with unanimity in the American legal community. In a subsequent case, Washington v. Glucksberg [80] , Justice John Paul Stevens noted in his concurring opinion that: Upholding the validity of the federal Bail Reform Act of 1984, the Court stated in United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987), that a facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid. Id. , at 745. I do not believe the Court has ever actually applied such a strict standard, even in Salerno itself, and the Court does not appear to apply Salerno here. Nevertheless, the Court does conceive of respondents' claim as a facial challenge--addressing not the application of the statute to a particular set of plaintiffs before it, but the constitutionality of the statute's categorical prohibition against aid[ing] another person to attempt suicide. [81] Further, in City of Chicago v. Morales [82] , the U.S. Supreme Court refused to work within the parameters ostensibly set forth in Salerno . Held the U.S. Supreme Court through Justice Stevens: ""There is no need, however, to decide whether the impact of the Chicago ordinance on constitutionally protected liberty alone would suffice to support a facial challenge under the overbreadth doctrine. For it is clear that the vagueness of this enactment makes a facial challenge appropriate. This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. It is a criminal law that contains no mens rea requirement, and infringes on constitutionally protected rights. When vagueness permeates the text of such a law, it is subject to facial attack."" [83] Moreover, the Salerno proposition is simply alien to the Philippine experience. Our jurisprudence has traditionally deigned to nullify or facially invalidate statutes or provisions thereof without need of considering whether ""no set of circumstances exists under which the [law or provision] would be valid."" Among recent examples of laws or legal provisions nullified as unconstitutional by this Court are B.P. Blg. 885, [84] the Marcos-issued Executive Order No. 626-A, [85] Section 46 of Rep. Act No. 4670, [86] Rep. Act No. 7056, [87] provisions of the 2000 General Appropriations Act passed by Congress, [88] and most recently, Section 47 of P.D. 198. [89] Indeed, in a similar vein to the observations of Justice Stevens as to the American experience, the impossibly high standard set forth in Salerno has never been applied squarely in this jurisdiction. If the auto-limiting philosophy set forth Salerno should have influence in this jurisdiction, it should only be to the effect that the remedy of constitutional nullification should be resorted to by the courts if there is no other means by which the unconstitutional defect of the law or legal provision can be treated. Then again, such a principle is already laid down by our accepted rules of statutory construction, such as that ""a statute should be construed whenever possible in a manner that will avoid conflict with the Constitution"", or that ""where a statute is reasonably susceptible of two constructions, one constitutional and the other unconstitutional, that construction in favor of its constitutionality shall be adopted, and the construction that will render it invalid rejected."" Our own jurisprudence must expressly reject Salerno , if only because that case has fostered the impression that a ""facial challenge,"" or a ""facial invalidation"" necessitates a demonstration that the law involved is unconstitutional in whatever application. Even though such impression is not universally accepted, our acceptance of the viability of either the ""facial challenge"" or ""facial invalidation"" in this jurisdiction without accompanying comment on Salerno might imply that the extremely high bar for judicial review set therein prevails in the Philippines. In order to avoid any further confusion, especially that which may be brought about by Salerno , I had proposed during deliberations the following definitions for usage in Philippine jurisprudence: As to standing The ability of a petitioner to bring forth a suit challenging the constitutionality of an enactment or provisions thereof, even if the petitioner has yet not been directly injured by the application of the law in question, is referred to as a ""facial challenge."" The ability of a petitioner to judicially challenge a law or provision of law that has been specifically applied against the petitioner is referred to as an ""as-applied challenge."" As to adjudication on the merits The nullification on constitutional grounds by the courts of a provision of law, or even of the entire statute altogether, is referred to as "" facial invalidation."" The invalidation of the application of a provision of law or a statute only insofar as it applies to the petitioner and others similarly situated, without need to nullify the law or provision thereof, is referred to as "" as-applied invalidation. "" I submit that these terms provide a greater degree of clarity than simply using ""facial challenge"" and ""as-applied challenge."" My subsequent discussion shall hence utilize such terms as well. V. The Court, this time and through this case, should reassert that the vagueness challenge is viable against penal statutes. The vagueness challenge is a critical defense to all persons against criminal laws that are arbitrarily drawn, formulated without thoughtful deliberation, or designed to yield to the law enforcer the determination whether an offense has been committed. Section 45(j) of Rep. Act 8189 is indeed a textbook example of a vague penal clause. The ponencia submits that Section 45(j) does not suffer from the infirmity as it ostensibly establishes that violation of any provision of Rep. Act No. 8189 is an election offense. I cannot accept the proposition that the violation of just any provision of Rep. Act No. 8189, as Section 45(j) declares with minimal fanfare, constitutes an election offense punishable with up to six (6) years of imprisonment. Section 45(j) categorizes the violation of any provision of Rep. Act 8189 as an election offense, thus effectively criminalizing such violations. Following Section 46 of the same law, any person found guilty of an election offense ""shall be punished with imprisonment of not less than one (1) year but not more than six (6) years."" Virtually all of the 52 provisions of Rep. Act 8189 define an act, establishes a policy, or imposes a duty or obligation on a voter, election officer or a subdivision of government. Virtually all of these provisions are susceptible to violation, the only qualifier being that they incorporate a verb. For example, Section 4 states that the ""precinct-level list of voters shall be accompanied by an addition/deletion list for the purpose of updating the list."" If the precinct-level list of voters is not accompanied by an addition/deletion list, an election offense is committed, according to Section 45(j). But if that is so, who commits the election offense? The COMELEC? What about if the attachment addition/deletion list was somehow alleged as not being geared towards updating the list? Would that constitute an election offense? Under Section 37, a voter who was excluded from the certified list of voters due to inadvertence or registered with an erroneous or misspelled name may file a petition for an order directing that his name be entered or corrected. Such voter is also required to attach to a ""certified copy of the registration record or identification car or the entry of his name in the certified list of voters used in the preceding election, together with the proof that his application was denied or not acted upon by the Election Registration Board."" If the voter fails to attach any of these requirements, no matter the reason, an election offense as defined under Section 45(j) has been committed, and the voter may be sentenced to prison. As to what precisely are the elements of this particular crime, I am at a loss to define. Even the most innocuous of oversights can be deemed as an election offense under Rep. Act 8189. For example, Section 10 requires that the applicant-voter submit four (4) identification-size copies of his/her latest photograph. If such voter submits only three (3) photos instead of four (4), then he/she is theoretically violating a provision of Rep. Act No. 8189, and is thus committing an election offense under Section 45(j) punishable by no less than one (1) year of imprisonment without the possibility of probation. Another example, Section 14 requires that the application for registration of a physically disabled person must be prepared by a relative within the fourth degree of consanguinity, the Election Officer, or a member of an accredited citizen's arm. If an elderly disabled widow has her trusted maid prepare the application for her, then an election offense is committed as such act violates a provision of Rep. Act No. 8189. The maid, or perhaps even the widow herself, may now face a prison term of no less than one (1) year. In his Separate Opinion, Justice Carpio provides even more telling illustrative samples [90] of crimes under Rep. Act 8189 if the draft ponencia were upheld. Indeed, one can make a parlor game out of discerning all the possible acts that constitute a crime because of Section 45(j). Yet any entertainment that can be derived out of such exercise will be muted because the consequence involves prison terms. The very absurdity of such implausible, yet legally possible prosecutions, lend doubt as to whether the legislature had truly intended such penal consequences. Because Section 45(j) is impermissibly vague, such doubts could be entertained, to consequences that are deleterious to our freedoms. If Section 45(j) were left by the Court as is, it would be a validation that our legislators so intended to penalize so trifling an offense. Moreover, not only does the vagueness of Section 45(j) deprive the voters, election officials, or indeed any live person (since the provisions of Rep. Act 8189 are susceptible to violation by just about anybody) of fair notice as to what conduct is exactly proscribed and criminalized. It also leaves prosecutors and judges at a loss as to how exactly to prosecute or adjudge an election offense under Section 45(j). We can reasonably presume that save for the specific election offenses under Section 45 (a) to (j) and the specific penal clause under Section 10 of Rep. Act 8189, all the other provisions of the law were not crafted with the intent to devise a penal provision. Outside of the bare text of the provision, it would be impossible to discern the precise elements of the crime, and since these provisions were not designed as penal provisions in the first place, there was no deliberate intent to design every subject-verb agreement as an element to a crime. For example, Section 14 provides that with respect to illiterate or disabled applicants, ""[t]he fact of illiteracy or disability shall be so indicated in the application [for registration]."" Shorn of any criminal context, as it most assuredly was in the minds of the legislators, the clause merely required that the fact of illiteracy or disability should be indicated in the application. Seen benignly, the only concern of the provision is that such fact be manifested in the application. Since the provision does not even mandate that it be the applicant himself or herself who should make such indication, there would be no impediment for the election officer to make the indication in behalf of the applicant. But if indeed that clause of Section 14 does actually embody an election offense, it would be virtually impossible for the prosecutor or the judge to ascertain the elements of such crime. Facially, there would appear only to be one element of the crime, the absence of any indication in the application of the fact of illiteracy or disability. But there is no indication on the face of the provision as to who exactly commits the crime. Neither is there clarity as to how exactly such crime is precisely committed. It bears remembering that it is the second concern of the vagueness doctrine, that the statute is precise enough that it does not invite arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by law enforcement authorities, that is perhaps the more important aspect of the doctrine. Section 45(j) is militantly offensive to that consideration. Our Philippine criminal laws are predicated on crimes that have precisely defined elements, and the task of the judge is to determine whether these elements have been proven beyond reasonable doubt. For the most part, each crime currently defined in our penal laws consist of only a handful of elements, providing the judge a clearly defined standard for conviction or acquittal. That is not the case for a penal provision predicated on ""any violation of this Act."" A legislative enactment can consist of 100 provisions. Each provision may describe just one act, right, duty or prohibition, or there could be several contained in just one provision. The catch-all penal provision ostensibly criminalizes the violation of any one right, duty, or prohibition, of which there could be hundreds in just one statute. Just any one of these possibly hundreds of acts mentioned in the law is an element of the consummated crime under the catch-all provision such as Section 45(j), thus greatly increasing the risk for conviction under such a provision. There could be literally hundreds of ways that a catch-all provision in just one law could become the source of imprisonment. Obviously, broader standards lead to broader discretion on the part of judges. Some judges may tend towards a narrow application of a provision such as Section 45(j), while others might be inclined towards its broad application. What is certain is that no consistent trend will emerge in criminal prosecutions for violations of provisions such as Section 45(j), a development that will not bode well for the fair and consistent administration of justice. Provisions such as Section 45(j) do nothing for the efficient administration of justice. Since such a provision is laced with unconstitutional infirmity, I submit it is the task of the Court to say so, in order that the courts will need not be confronted with this hydra of statutory indeterminacy. The COMELEC did point out that an election offense under Section 45(j) is malum prohibitum , which is a correct restatement of prevailing doctrine, yet a prospect that makes the provision even more disturbing. Returning to Section 14, the illiterate or disabled voter precisely requires special assistance because of his/her personal condition which impairs the ability to properly fill up the application form. As such, the likelihood of inadvertently failing to indicate the fact of illiteracy or disability is present. Since any criminal intent is irrelevant, any honest mistake unforgivable, just because Rep. Act 8189 embodies malum prohibitum offenses, the illiterate or disabled voter who inadvertently fails to indicate the fact of his/her impairment in the application simply has no defense against imprisonment, except the pity of the judge. And even then, such pity, if wielded, may exceed the discretion of the judge since the application of the malum prohibitum law simply calls for the execution of its penal clauses once the offense has been established. Dura lex sed lex , indeed. VI. I now wish to address certain points raised by the ponente in rebuttal of my arguments. The claim that the Court should not touch upon the constitutionality of Section 45(j) because it is not the lis mota of the case is, with due respect, absurd. While the ponencia claims that the lis mota of this case is the alleged grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COMELEC, it cannot be denied that the valid prosecution of the petitioners integrally depends on the constitutionality of Section 45(j). It appears that the real reason the majority refuses to acknowledge that the constitutionality of Section 45(j) is the lis mota is simply because they do not find that provision unconstitutional, as roundabout a path to reason as there ever has been. The other contentions of the ponente submitted in rebuttal to my position warrant more extensive dissection. A. The ponente invokes People v. Gatchalian [91] in an attempt to convince that a ""catch-all"" penal provision is not inherently unconstitutional, since the Court in 1958, ruling 6-3, had sustained a criminal prosecution based on such a provision found in the since-repealed Minimum Wage Law [92] . However, with all due respect, the discussion fails to take into account distinguishing nuances and contexts that differentiate Gatchalian and its relevant statutes from the present case and Rep. Act No. 8189. We cannot deny the fact that the void-for-vagueness constitutional challenge, as with some other standards of constitutional adjudication, had not yet found full fruition within our own jurisprudence at the time Gatchalian was decided in 1958, a year when the oldest members of the Court were still studying in law school, and the youngest among us still in short pants. Indeed, the jurisprudential appreciation then of our fundamental constitutional rights differed in several critical respects from our presently accepted standards. In 1958, evidence seized from unconstitutional searches and seizures were admissible into evidence, as the court adopted the exclusionary rule only in 1967 with Stonehill v. Diokno . In 1958, the suspension of that fundamental right - the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus - was still believed to be a political question which could not be the subject of judicial inquiry, the adverse rule emerging only in 1971 with Lansang v. Garcia. [93] In 1958, there was yet no express recognition from this Court of a constitutional right to privacy independent from the right to liberty, such recognition came only in 1968 with Morfe v. Mutuc. [94] These are but a few of the more prominent examples that can be plumbed from our jurisprudence. I raise this point for I respectfully submit that Gatchalian can conclusively settle the present case in favor of the ponente 's position only if we believe in a static and unyielding theory of jurisprudence that blindly ignores the refreshing new insights and wisdoms each new generation gifts to civilization. Our own jurisprudential history indubitably reveals that this Court does not adhere to so rigid an ideology. A vote that Section 45(j) is constitutional only for the simple reason that a like-minded provision was sustained way back in 1958 would be premised on a philosophy utterly alien to the progressive traditions of the Supreme Court. We need to view the questions now material at bar with a fresh perspective, with an understanding that we may need to break new ground if need be, to arrive at the proper and enlightened resolution of the question. Gatchalian cannot serve as crutch to sustain the constitutionality of Section 45(j). It is eminently possible to declare the nullity of Section 45(j) without having to invalidate the core reasoning and ultimate result of Gatchalian . B. In Gatchalian, the accused therein was prosecuted under Section 15(a) of the Minimum Wage Law. Said provision reads: SEC. 15. Penalties and recovery of wage due under this Act. -- (a) Any person who willfully violates any of the provisions of this Act shall upon conviction thereof be subject to a fine of not more than two thousand pesos, or, upon second conviction, to imprisonment of not more then one year, or to both fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court. The accused in Gatchalian was alleged to have violated, in particular, Section 3 of the Minimum Wage Law, which prescribed the minimum wage rates an employer ""shall pay to each of his employees"". The key mark in Section 15 is its qualification that there must be a ""willful violation of any of the provisions"" of the Minimum Wage Law before a criminal prosecution can be had. This distinguishes from Section 45(j), which does not offer such a critical qualification of intent. The indispensable presence of ""willful violation"" as an element to the criminal offense supplies the penal statute with mens rea , an element which has been defined as a guilty mind, a guilty or wrongful purpose or criminal intent. In the 1998 case of City of Chicago v. Morales . [95] one of the cases which I have extensively cited, the U.S. Supreme Court had comfortably ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court has comfortably held that a criminal law that contains no mens rea requirement infringes on constitutionally protected rights. Crucially, the Court majority [96] that decided Gatchalian expressly emphasized the fact that Section 15 expressly limited such prosecutions only to ""willful violations"" when it affirmed the provision. It is clear from the above-quoted provisions that while Section 3 explicitly requires every owner of an establishment located outside of Manila or its environs to pay each of its employees P3.00 a day on the effective date of the Act, and one year thereafter P4.00 a day, Section 15 imposes both a criminal penalty for a willful violation of any of the above provisions and a civil liability for any underpayment of wages due an employee. The intention of the law is clear: to slap not only a criminal liability upon an erring employer for any willful violation of the acts sought to be enjoined but to attach concurrently a civil liability for any underpayment he may commit as a result thereof. The law speaks of a willful violation of any of the provisions of this Act, which is all-embracing, and the same must include what is enjoined in Section 3 thereof which embodies the very fundamental purpose for which the law has been adopted. [97] Had the Court ruled Section 45(j) of the Voter's Registration Act unconstitutional, such pronouncement will not overturn or even be intellectually inconsistent with Gatchalian . For one, there are enough textual qualifications in Section 15 as opposed to Section 45(j) that spell the difference between a constitutional penal statute and a void one. Moreover, the same constitutional considerations we have and will fully consider in this petition were not addressed in Gatchalian . The accused in Gatchalian had premised his motion to dismiss on two grounds: that Section 3 carried only a civil liability and did not constitute a criminal offense; and assuming that Section 3 did constitute a criminal offense, the same provision did not carry any penalty penalizing it. [98] These were the two distinct issues which were addressed by the majority, and also to which the three dissenters responded to. The difference between those issues as formulated in Gatchalian and those presently confronting us is self-evident. Still, the accused in Gatchalian did offer the following argument that may be taken into account as we consider the present case. The argument pertains to the proper interpretation of Section 15(a), which the accused had argued would result in absurdity should it ""be interpreted in a manner that would embrace a willful violation of any of the provisions of the law."" [99] As recounted in Gatchalian : Counsel for appellee however entertains a different interpretation. He contends that if Section 15(a) should be interpreted in a manner that would embrace a wilful violation of any of the provisions of the law we would have a situation where even the officials entrusted with its enforcement may be held criminally liable which is not contemplated in the law. Thus, he contends, the Secretary of Labor may be criminally prosecuted for willfully not using all available devices for investigation [Section 4(c)], for not presenting to the Wage Board all the evidence in his possession relating to the wages in the industries for which the Wage Board is appointed and other information relevant to the establishment of the minimum wage [Section 5(p)], and for not doing all other acts which the law requires him to do under Section 6. This, he emphasizes, is absurd and should not be entertained. [100] The tenor of this argument is teasingly similar to that adopted by an esteemed colleague and myself in our respective submissions. The ponente has more or less responded dismissively towards this arguments, relying on comforting platitudes such as ""the wisdom of a law is beyond this Court's function of inquiry."" Perhaps, considering that the ponente now relies on Gatchalian , it should be expected that the Gatchalian Court would have responded to the above-quoted argument in a like-manner. But it clearly did not. Instead, it emphasized: To begin with, the Minimum Wage Law is a social legislation which has been adopted for the benefit of labor and as such it contains provisions that are enjoined to be observed by the employer. These provisions are substantive in nature and had been adopted for common observance by the persons affected. They cannot be eluded nor subverted lest the erring employer runs into the sanction of the law. On the other hand, the provisions adverted to by counsel are merely administrative in character which had been adopted to set the machinery by which the law is to be enforced. They are provisions established for observance by the officials entrusted with its enforcement. Failure to comply with them would therefore subject them merely to administrative sanction. They do not come under the penal clause embodied in Section 15(a). This is clearly inferred from Section 18(c), of Republic Act No. 602, which provides: Any official of the Government to whom responsibility in administration and enforcement has been delegated under this Act shall be removable on the sustaining of charges of malfeasance or non-feasance in office. This specific provision should be interpreted as qualifying the penal clause provided for in Section 15(a). [101] The Court in Gatchalian plainly realized and acknowledged that there are limitations to the plausible application of Section 15(a), even if these were not textually committed in the provision itself. The most sweeping of these limitations is the admonition that those administrative officials charged with correlative rights and duties under the Minimum Wage Law could not be criminally liable under Section 15(a), despite the absence of any such clarificatory language in the law itself. I myself am not too comfortable with the methodology used by the Court in so qualifying, considering the absence of any statutory support that would have indubitably justified this conclusion. [102] Yet if we were to examine this passage in the present context, where considerations on the question of void-for-vagueness have fully blossomed, the Court in Gatchalian expressly acknowledged that Section 15(a) would have been untenable in some applications, such as if an administrative officer were criminally charged under that provision. In effect, the Court tacitly acknowledged in Gatchalian that Section 15(a) was indeed void-for-vagueness, and that line of attack would have been viable to any administrative officer actually charged under that provision. It would have been one thing for the Court in Gatchalian to have approached that argument by responding that the wisdom of Section 15(a) was beyond judicial inquiry. That approach would have aligned with that of the ponente . Instead, Gatchalian rejected that approach and instead expressed an opinion that current-day commentators would appreciate as an embryonic formulation of the ""void-as-applied"" principle. VII. Since it has been established that Section 45(j) infringes on procedural due process, the final inquiry should be whether the nullification of Section 45(j) is warranted. Given the problem of vagueness that attends to Section 45(j), is facial invalidation of the statute warranted? The practical value of facial invalidation in this case cannot be discounted. Unless Section 45(j) is nullified, it may still be utilized as a means of criminal prosecution. Because there are dozens, if not hundreds, of different contexts under which a criminal offense may carved out of Section 45(j), limiting the challenges to the provision to ""as-applied"" and its case-by-case method will prove woefully inadequate in addressing the elemental lack of fair notice that plagues the provision. The very vagueness of Section 45(j) makes it an ideal vehicle for political harassment. The election season will undoubtedly see a rise in the partisan political temperature, where competing candidates and their camps will employ every possible legal tactic to gain an advantage over the opponents. Among these possible tactics would be the disenfranchisement of voters who may be perceived as supporters of the other side; or the disqualification of election officers perceived as either biased or impartial enough to hamper a candidate with ill-motives. The disenfranchisement of voters or the disqualification of election officers could be accomplished through prosecutions for election offenses. Even if these prosecutions do not see fruition, the mere filing of such charges could be enough to dampen enthusiasm in voting, or strike fear in conducting honest and orderly elections. Unfortunately, Section 45(j) is an all too easy tool for mischief of this sort. One can invent any sort of prosecution using any provision of Rep. Act No. 8189 that would fall within the ambit of the offending Section 45(j). It would not even matter if the charge is meritorious or not, just the systematic filing of complaints based on Section 45(j) is sufficient to alter the political climate in any locality. I find it odd, suspicious even, that the COMELEC is insisting on prosecution the petitioners on Section 45(j), and not the Omnibus Election Code. The acts for which they are charged are classified as an election offense under Section 261(y) of the Omnibus Election Code which specifically charges as election offenses ""any person who knowingly makes any false or untruthful statement relative to any of the data or information required in the application for registration;"" and ""any voter who, being a registered voter, registers anew without filing an application for cancellation of his previous registration."" I have no idea whether the COMELEC sees this case as a test case for prosecutions under Section 45(j). What I do know is that if the Court debunks the present challenge to Section 45(j), the COMELEC will be emboldened to pursue more prosecutions under Section 45(j), a prospect that would hearten the most partisan of political operatives. The result would not only be more frivolous complaints for violation of Section 45(j), but also an undue and utterly unnecessary temperature rise in the political climate. It might be argued that a ruling that simply imposes an ""as-applied invalidation"" on Section 45(j) would sufficiently disquiet such concern. I disagree. Any room left for discretion or interpretation of Section 45(j) would be sufficient for one with intent to harass voters or election officials with the threat of prosecution under that provision. After all, just the mere filing of the complaint is enough to effect harassment. Besides, I submit that the acts already expressly criminalized as election offenses, whether under the Omnibus Election Code, or under Rep. Act No. 8189, already encompass the whole range of election offenses that could possibly be committed. The petitioners could have been charged instead with violating Section 261(y) of the Omnibus Election Code. In recent years, Congress has chosen to employ phraseology similar to Section 45(j) in a number of laws, such as the Cooperative Code, [103] the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act, [104] and the Retail Trade Liberalization Act. [105] I know from my own experience that this is the product of a legislative predilection to utilize a standard template in the crafting of bills. I have come to believe that this standard phraseology constitutes a dangerous trend, and a clear stand from this Court that Section 45(j) is unconstitutional for being void-for-vagueness would make the legislature think twice before employing such terminology in the laws that it passes. The problem is less obvious if the law in question contains only a few provisions, where any person can be reasonably expected to ascertain with ease what particular acts are made criminal. However, in more extensive laws such as Rep. Act No. 8189 or the especially long codes, such expectation could not be reasonably met. I am aware that compliance with the requisites for the publication of laws is considered legally sufficient for the purposes of notice to the public, but I submit that a measure of reason should be appreciated in evaluating that requirement. If a law runs 400 pages long, with each sentence detailing an act that is made criminal in nature, the doctrine ""ignorance of the law excuses no one"" should not be made a ready and convenient excuse, especially if, as in Rep. Act 8189, the act is made criminal only by implication of a provision such as Section 45(j). We should think of the public good that would prevail if the Court makes the stand that Congress cannot criminalize a whole range of behavior by simply adding a multi-purpose, catch-all provision such as Section 45(j). Congress will be forced to deliberate which precise activities should be made criminal. Such deliberate thought leads to definitive laws that do not suffer the vice of void-for-vagueness. These definite laws will undoubtedly inform the people which acts are criminalized, a prospect wholly consonant with constitutional guarantees of fair notice and due process. No doubt, Section 45(j) and its ilk in law are dangerous provisions. It would be best if the Court send a message that this intended prosecution of the petitioners could be accomplished only through the Omnibus Election Code, which after all specifically penalizes the acts for which they are alleged to have committed. In the case at bar, an ideal resolution would be to grant the petition and void Section 45(j) and the COMELEC resolutions authorizing prosecution under it, but without prejudice to the authorization of prosecution of the petitioners under the Omnibus Election Code, assuming of course such a tack is still legally feasible. This solution would satisfy whatever motivation there is to sanction the petitioners, yet at the same time make it clear to the COMELEC that prosecutions under Section 45(j) of Rep. Act No. 8189 cannot avail before this Court. At the same time, the Court would be able to reiterate comforting precepts - that prosecutions under criminal laws that specifically define and particularly criminalize the acts constituting the offense are preferred over those laws that broadly define criminal offenses; that the Court will not provide sanctuary to any abusive resort to Section 45(j) of Rep. Act No. 8189; and that would-be voters who neglect to pay great care to the process of voter registration will face the sanction of the law. Sad to say, the majority's ruling today is beyond comprehension. No good will come out of it. For one, it opens a Pandora's box of all sorts of malicious wholesale prosecutions of innocent voters at the instance of political partisans desirous to abuse the law for electoral gain. It emboldens Congress to continue incorporating exactly the same provision in the laws it enacts, no matter how many hundreds of acts or provisions are contained in the particular statute. For that matter, it signals that vague penal laws are acceptable in this jurisdiction. Left unabated, the doctrine will be reflexively parroted by judges, lawyers and law students memorizing for their bar exams until it is accepted as the entrenched rule, even though it simply makes no sense. Bad folk wisdom handed down through the generations is soon regarded as gospel truth. I sincerely hope the same mistake is not made with the lamentable doctrine affirmed by the majority today.

DISSENTING OPINION CARPIO, J.: Petitioners are charged under two Informations for violation of Section 10(g) and (j) [1] in relation to Section 45(j) of Republic Act No. 8189. [2] RA No. 8189 does not state that violations of Section 10(g) and (j) are election offenses. However, Section 45(j) makes a blanket declaration that "" [V]iolation of any of the provisions of this Act "" is an election offense. Petitioners now assail Section 45(j) as unconstitutional for vagueness as it does not refer to any particular provision of RA No. 8189. Petitioners claim a violation of their constitutional right under the due process clause . [3] Petitioners assert that a penal statute must provide ""fair notice"" of what is a criminal act and what is a lawful act. Petitioners claim that Section 45(j), a penal law that carries the penalty of imprisonment from one to six years, [4] violates their constitutional right to ""fair notice"" because it is vague. The due process clause, which guarantees that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, requires that citizens are given sufficient notice or warning of what is lawful and unlawful conduct under a penal statute. To enforce this guarantee, courts have developed the void for vagueness doctrine. The void for vagueness doctrine expresses the rule that for an act to constitute a crime, the law must expressly and clearly declare such act a crime. A related doctrine is that penal statutes are construed strictly against the state and liberally in favor of the accused. Petitioners' constitutional attack on Section 45(j) under the due process clause puts in issue two other requirements for the validity of a penal statute. First, a penal statute must prescribe an ascertainable standard of guilt to guide courts in adjudication. [5] Second, a penal statute must confine law enforcers within well-defined boundaries to avoid arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement of the law. [6] Petitioners challenge the constitutionality of Section 45(j) "" as applied "" to them in a live case under which they face prosecution. This is the traditional ""as applied"" approach in challenging the constitutionality of any statute. In an ""as applied"" challenge, the petitioner who claims a violation of his constitutional right can raise any constitutional ground - whether absence of due process, lack of fair notice, lack of ascertainable standards, overbreadth, or vagueness. The ""as applied"" approach embodies the rule that one can challenge the constitutionality of a statute only if he asserts a violation of his own rights. The rule prohibits one from challenging the constitutionality of the statute based solely on the violation of the rights of third persons not before the court. This rule is also known as the prohibition against third-party standing. The U.S. Supreme Court has created a notable exception to the prohibition against third-party standing. Under the exception, a petitioner may mount a "" facial "" challenge to the constitutionality of a statute even if he claims no violation of his own rights under the assailed statute. To mount a ""facial"" challenge, a petitioner has only to show violation under the assailed statute of the rights of third parties not before the court. This exception allowing ""facial"" challenges, however, applies only to statutes involving free speech . The ground allowed for a ""facial"" challenge is overbreadth or vagueness of the statute. Thus, the U.S. Supreme Court declared: x x x the Court has altered its traditional rules of standing to permit - in the First Amendment area - `attacks on overly broad statutes with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with the requisite narrow specificity.' x x x Litigants, therefore, are permitted to challenge a statute not because their own rights of free expression are violated, but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute's very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression. [7] (Emphasis supplied) The rationale for this exception allowing a ""facial"" challenge is to counter the ""chilling effect"" on protected speech that comes from statutes violating free speech. A person who does not know whether his speech constitutes a crime under an overbroad or vague law may simply refuse to speak to avoid being charged of a crime. The overbroad or vague law chills him into silence. Prof. Erwin Chemerinsky, a distinguished American textbook writer on Constitutional Law, explains clearly the exception of overbreadth to the rule prohibiting third-party standing in this manner: The third exception to the prohibition against third-party standing is termed the ""overbreadth doctrine."" A person generally can argue that a statute is unconstitutional as it is applied to him or her; the individual cannot argue that a statute is unconstitutional as it is applied to third parties not before the court. For example, a defendant in a criminal trial can challenge the constitutionality of the law that is the basis for the prosecution solely on the claim that the statute unconstitutionally abridges his or her constitutional rights. The overbreadth doctrine is an exception to the prohibition against third-party standing. It permits a person to challenge a statute on the ground that it violates the First Amendment (free speech) rights of third parties not before the court, even though the law is constitutional as applied to that defendant. In other words, the overbreadth doctrine provides that: ""Given a case or controversy, a litigant whose own activities are unprotected may nevertheless challenge a statute by showing that it substantially abridges the First Amendment rights of other parties not before the court."" [8] The overbreadth doctrine is closely related to the vagueness doctrine. [9] Both doctrines are often simultaneously invoked to mount ""facial"" challenges to statutes violating free speech. [10] The doctrines of overbreadth and vagueness, as devices to mount ""facial"" challenges to penal or non-penal statutes violating free speech , are not applicable to the present petition for two reasons. First, petitioners here assert a violation of their own constitutional rights, not the rights of third-parties. Second, the challenged statute - Section 45(j) of RA No. 8189, does not involve free speech. Thus, any invocation of the doctrines of overbreadth and vagueness to mount a ""facial"" challenge in the present case is grossly misplaced. Justice Vicente Mendoza's separate opinion in Estrada v. Sandiganbayan , [11] a case involving both ""facial"" and ""as applied"" challenges to specific provisions of the Anti-Plunder Law, correctly distinguished between the inapplicability of the ""facial"" challenge and the applicability of the ""as applied"" challenge in that case. Justice Mendoza succinctly stated, ""As conduct - not speech - is its object, the challenged provision must be examined only ""as applied"" to the defendant, herein petitioner, and should not be declared unconstitutional for overbreadth or vagueness [under a ""facial"" challenge]."" Justice Mendoza further explained in his separate opinion denying the motion for reconsideration: x x x Accordingly, as the enforcement of the Anti-Plunder Law is not alleged to produce a chilling effect on freedom of speech or religion or some ""fundamental rights"" to be presently discussed, only such provisions can be challenged by petitioner as are sought to be applied to him. Petitioner cannot challenge the entire statute on its face . A contrary rule would permit litigation to turn on abstract hypothetical applications of a statute and disregard the wise limits placed on the judicial power by the Constitution. x x x (Emphasis supplied) [12] In Romualdez v. Sandiganbayan , [13] petitioner Romualdez challenged the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act for which petitioner Romualdez was being prosecuted. The case clearly involved an ""as applied"" challenge to the constitutionality of a statute. Thus, petitioner Romualdez could raise any constitutional ground, including overbreadth and vagueness, to strike down Section 5. Indeed, the Court in Romualdez stated that "" the challenged provision must be examined only ""as applied"" to the defendant ."" After discussing the void for vagueness doctrine, the Court ruled that ""the challenged provision is not vague,"" thus acknowledging that the constitutionality of a penal statute can be tested by the vagueness doctrine. Unfortunately, the Court in Romualdez also stated: ""It is best to stress at the outset that the overbreadth and the vagueness doctrines have special application only to free-speech cases. They are not appropriate for testing the validity of penal statutes."" The Court concluded: ""In sum, the Court holds that the challenged provision is not vague, and that in any event, the `overbreadth' and `void for vagueness' doctrines are not applicable to this case."" However, we must view these statements of the Court on the inapplicability of the overbreadth and vagueness doctrines to penal statutes as appropriate only insofar as these doctrines are used to mount ""facial"" challenges to penal statutes not involving free speech. These statements of the Court are also obiter dicta since Romualdez involved an ""as applied"" challenge and not a ""facial"" challenge to the constitutionality of a statute. The present petition indisputably involves an ""as applied"" challenge to the constitutionality of Section 45(j) of RA No. 8189. As an ""as applied"" challenge, petitioners may raise any constitutional ground to strike down Section 45(j). In this ""as applied"" challenge, petitioners may invoke the overbreadth and vagueness doctrines to test the constitutionality of Section 45(j). The threshold issue on the constitutionality of Section 45(j) now turns on three tests: First , does Section 45(j) give ""fair notice"" or warning to ordinary citizens as to what is criminal conduct and what is lawful conduct? Put differently, is Section 45(j) so vague that ordinary citizens must necessarily guess as to its meaning and differ as to its application? [14] Second , is Section 45(j) so vague that it prescribes no ascertainable standard of guilt to guide courts in judging those charged of its violation? [15] Third , is Section 45(j) so vague that law enforcers - the police and prosecutors - can arbitrarily or selectively enforce it? [16] If Section 45(j) meets all the three tests, it complies with the due process clause and is therefore constitutional. If it fails any one of the three tests, then it is unconstitutional and the two Informations against petitioners based on Section 45(j) should be quashed. RA No. 8189 contains 52 sections and some 235 sentences, 149 paragraphs, and 7,831 words. Section 45(j) of RA No. 8189 makes "" violation of any of the provisions "" of RA No. 8189 a criminal offense, in addition to violations expressly specified in Section 45(a) to (i). [17] Section 45(j) of RA No. 8189 provides: SEC. 45. Election Offenses. - The following shall be considered election offenses under this Act: (a) x x x x x x (j) Violation of any of the provisions of this Act . (Emphasis supplied) Thus, the violation of any of the following provisions of RA No. 8189, not covered under Section 45(a) to (i), is a crime: Section 10, requiring that the voter's ""application shall contain the following data,"" listing 11 data (a to k) to be written by the applicant. The 11 th data required is ""such information or data as may be required by the Commission."" If the applicant fails to write the data required by the Commission, he commits a crime. Here, petitioners are charged with violating Section 10(g) and ((j) for their alleged failure to state in their application form the periods of their residence in the Philippines, as well as for allegedly falsely stating that they are not registered voters in any other precinct. Section 10, requiring that the ""application for registration shall contain three (3) specimen signatures of the applicant, clear and legible rolled prints of his left and right thumbprints, with four identification size copies of his latest photograph x x x."" If the applicant writes only two specimen signatures or his thumbprints are not clear and legible, he commits a crime . Section 11(e), stating that insane or incompetent persons ""shall be disqualified from registering."" If an insane or incompetent person registers as a voter, he commits a crime . Section 18, requiring that a challenge to an applicant for registration ""shall be under oath."" If the challenger fails to put his challenge under oath, he commits a crime . Section 27, requiring that the Election Registration Board ""shall deactivate the registration and remove the registration records"" of ""any person who did not vote in the two (2) successive preceding regular elections."" Members of the Election Registration Board commit a crime if they fail to do so . Section 29, requiring that the Election Registration Board ""shall cancel the registration records of those who died as certified by the Local Civil Registrar."" If the members of the Election Registration Board fail to do so, they commit a crime . Section 40, requiring that the Commission on Elections ""shall reconstitute all registration records which have been lost or destroyed."" If the members of the Commission on Elections fail to do so, they commit a crime . By no means is the foregoing enumeration exhaustive. There are many more provisions of RA No. 8189 that may be violated by a voter, Election Officer, or other officials of the Commission on Elections without committing the ""Election Offenses"" specified in Section 45(a) to (i) of RA No. 8189. However, the ordinary citizen has no way of knowing which provisions of RA No. 8189 are covered by Section 45(j) even if he has before him a copy of RA No. 8189. Even Judges and Justices will differ as to which provisions of RA No. 8189 fall under Section 45(j). The prosecution office of the Comelec has not specified which provisions of RA No. 8189 fall under Section 45(j). There is no legal textbook writer who has attempted to enumerate the provisions of RA No. 8189 that fall under Section 45(j). Members of the Commission on Elections will certainly dispute that failure by the Commission to reconstitute lost or destroyed registration records constitutes a crime on their part. Under RA No. 8189, law enforcement officers have wide latitude to choose which provisions of the law to consider a crime since there is no specific enumeration of provisions falling under Section 45(j). Prosecutors can choose to prosecute only those who violate certain provisions of RA No. 8189. Judges trying violators of the law have no ascertainable standard to determine the guilt of a person accused of violating Section 45(j). There is no certainty which provisions of RA No. 8189 fall under Section 45(j). Section 45(j) makes a blanket, unconditional declaration that ""violation of any of the provisions"" of RA No. 8189 constitutes a crime. In contrast, Section 45(b) [18] states that to constitute a crime the failure to give notice or to submit a report must be "" without cause ."" Under Section 45(j), whether the violation or omission is with or without cause, the act constitutes a crime while under Section 45(b) a violation or omission for cause is not a crime. Certainly, the lawmaker did not intend that trivial and harmless violations, or omissions for cause, should constitute a crime under Section 45(j). Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing with certainty what these trivial and harmless violations or omissions are. Everyone will have to guess as to what provisions fall under Section 45(j), and their guesses will most likely differ from each other. The last paragraph of Section 4 [19] of RA No. 8189 prohibits a change of the precinct assignment of a voter without the voter's written consent. This paragraph expressly declares, ""Any violation thereof shall constitute an election offense which shall be punished in accordance with law."" The prohibition against such change of precinct assignment is not one of the specific acts penalized under Section 45(a) to (i). Since such change of precinct assignment is expressly declared an election offense in Section 4 itself, such act is clearly a crime and merits the penalty prescribed in Section 46. However, the provision in the last paragraph of Section 4 declaring a violation of such paragraph an election offense is not found in any other provision of RA No. 8189. The ordinary citizen will not know if the lawmaker also intended other provisions of RA No. 8189 to carry the same penal sanction, even in the absence of an express declaration that violation of such provisions is an election offense. This adds to the uncertainty of the ordinary citizen as to what constitutes criminal conduct and what constitutes lawful conduct under RA No. 8189. A provision in an elaborate and detailed law that contains a catch-all provision making it a crime to violate any provision of such law does not give ""fair notice"" to the ordinary citizen on what constitutes prohibited conduct or permitted conduct under such law. Section 45(j) does not draw reasonably clear lines between lawful and unlawful conduct such that the ordinary citizen has no way of finding out what conduct is a prohibited act. [20] The ordinary citizen will have to guess which provisions of RA No. 8189, other than those mentioned in Section 45(a) to (i), carry a penal sanction. If Section 45(j) had enumerated the specific provisions within its coverage, then reasonable clear lines would guide the ordinary citizen as to what acts are prohibited. Section 45(j) does not specify those provisions and thus fails to draw reasonable clear lines. If Section 45(j) is strictly applied, the ordinary citizen may simply decline to exercise his right of suffrage to avoid unintentionally committing a crime. Section 45(j) is a trap even to the most educated citizen. There is no basis in the claim that since petitioners are being prosecuted under Section 45(j) in relation to Section 10 (g) and (j) , there is no vagueness in the law under which petitioners are charged. Precisely, Section 45(j) does not specify Section 10(g) and (j) as some the provisions of RA No. 8189 that may be violated. Only the Information filed by the prosecutor mentions Section 10(g) and (j) as some of the provisions that may be violated under Section 45(j). The Information, however, is not part of RA No. 8189, and the prosecutor has no legislative power to amend Section 45(j) to cure its vagueness. A penal law void for vagueness is not made valid by a specification in the Information correcting the vagueness in the law. No court of law has adopted a doctrine that the prosecutor has the power to correct a vagueness in a penal law. Whether a law is void for vagueness under an ""as applied"" challenge must be tested under the provisions of the law as found in the statute books, and not as interpreted by the prosecutor in the Information . There is also no basis in the claim that any discussion on the possible provisions of RA No. 8189 that may fall within the coverage of Section 45(j) constitutes a ""facial"" challenge on such provisions of RA No. 8189. This is gross error. What is void for vagueness is the provision "" violation of any of the provisions of this Act ,"" and not any of the unnamed provisions that may be violated . No other provision in RA No. 8189 is being challenged as unconstitutional, only Section 45(j). The provisions possibl y falling within the coverage of Section 45(j) must be discussed to illustrate that the ordinary citizen has no way of knowing with certitude what provisions of RA No. 8189 fall within the coverage of Section 45(j). The discussion shows that the ordinary citizen has no fair notice that these are the provisions falling within the coverage of Section 45(j). What is being challenged is the constitutionality of Section 45(j), which is so vague that it could cover any of the provisions discussed above. In People v. Gatchalian , [21] the Court declared constitutional a provision penalizing ""any person who wilfully violates any of the provisions"" of the Minimum Wage Law. There, the Court stated: x x x A study of the origin of our Minimum Wage Law (Republic Act 602) may be of help in arriving at an enlightened and proper interpretation of the provisions under consideration. Our research shows that this Act was patterned after the U. S. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and so a comparative study of the pertinent provisions of both would be enlightening. The pertinent provisions of the U. S. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, follow: MINIMUM WAGES SEC. 6. (a) Every employer shall pay to each of his employees who is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce wages at the following rates -- (1) not less than 75 cents an hour; xxx         xxx          xxx PROHIBITED ACTS SEC. 15. (a) After the expiration of one hundred and twenty, days from the date of enactment of this Act, it shall be unlawful for any person -- (1) to transport, offer for transportation, ship, deliver, or sell in commerce, or to ship, deliver; or sell with knowledge that shipment or delivery or sale thereof in commerce is intended, any goods in the production of which any employee was employed in violation of section 6 or section 7, or in violation of any regulation or order of the Administrator issued under section 14; xxx (2) to violate any of the provisions of section 6 or section 7, or any of the provisions of any regulation or order of the Administrator issued under section 14; (3) to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or cause to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this Act, or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding, or has served or is about to serve on an industry committee; (4) to violate any of the provisions of section 11 (c) or any regulation or order made or continued in effect under the provisions of section 11 (d), or to make any statement, report, or record filed or kept pursuant. to the provisions of such section or of any regulation or order thereunder, knowing such statement, report, or record to be false in a material respect. xxx          xxx          xxx PENALTIES SEC. 16. (a) Any person who willfully violates any of the provisions of section 15 shall upon conviction thereof be subject to a line of not more than P10,000, or to imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. No person shall be imprisoned under this subsection except for an offense committed after the conviction of such person for a prior offense under this subsection. (b) Any employer who violates the provisions of section 6 or 7 of this Act shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and in additional equal amount as liquidated damages. Action to recover such liability may be maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated. No employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought. The court in such action shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow a reasonable attorney's fee to be paid by the defendant costs of the action. The pertinent provisions of Republic Act 602 read: SEC. 3. Minimum wage. -- (a) Every employer shall pay to each of his employees who is employed by an enterprise other than in agriculture wages at the rate of not less than -- xxx         xxx         xxx (2) Three pesos a day on the effective date of this Act and for one year after the effective date, and thereafter P4 a day, for employees of establishments located outside of Manila or its environs: Provided, That this Act shall not apply to any retail or service enterprise that regularly employs not more than five employees. SEC. 15. Penalties and recovery of wage due under this Act. -- (a) Any person who willfully violates any of the provisions of this Act shall upon conviction thereof be subject to a fine of not more than two thousand pesos, or, upon second conviction, to imprisonment of not more than one year, or to both fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court. xxx         xxx        xxx (e) Any employer who underpays an employee in violation of this Act shall be liable to the employee effected in the amount of the unpaid wages with legal interest. Action to recover such liability may be maintained in any competent court by anyone or more employees on behalf of himself or themselves. The court in such action shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow a reasonable attorney's fee which shall not exceed ten per cent of the amount awarded to the plaintiffs, unless the amount awarded is less than one hundred pesos, in which event the fee may be ten pesos, but not in excess of that amount. Payment of the amount found due to the plaintiffs shall be made directly to the plaintiffs, in the presence of a representative of the Secretary or of the Court. In the event payment is witnessed by the court or its representative, the Secretary shall be notified within ten days of payment that the payment has been made. x x x It should also be noted that while Section 16 of the Fair Labor Standards Act which provides for the penalties to be imposed for any willful violation of the provisions of the Act; specifically states that those penalties refer to acts declared unlawful under Section 15 of the same Act, our law does not contain such specification. It merely provides in Section 15 (a) that  Any person who willfully violates any of the provisions of this Act shall upon conviction  be subject to the penalty therein prescribed. This distinction is very revealing. It clearly indicates that while the Fair Labor Standards Act intends to subject to criminal action only acts that are declared unlawful, our law by legislative fiat intends to punish not only those expressly declared unlawful but even those not so declared but are clearly enjoined to be observed to carry out the fundamental purpose of the law. One such provision is undoubtedly that which refers to the payment of the minimum wage embodied in Section 3. This is the only rational interpretation that can be drawn from the attitude of our Congress in framing our law in a manner different from that appearing in the mother law. [22] (Boldfacing and underscoring supplied) This Court must revisit Gatchalian's holding that makes a crime "" not only those (acts) expressly declared unlawful but even those not so declared but are clearly enjoined to be observed to carry out the fundamental purpose of the law."" Unlike the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act after which our Republic Act No. 602 was patterned, RA 602 does not specify the provisions of the law the violation of which is declared unlawful. This Court must categorically rule that only acts expressly declared unlawful or prohibited by law, and penalized as such, are crimes. Acts not expressly declared unlawful or prohibited can never give rise to criminal liability. Any ambiguity in the law whether an act constitutes a crime is resolved in favor of the accused. To punish as crimes acts not expressly declared unlawful or prohibited by law violates the Bill of Rights. First , the Constitution provides that ""[N]o person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law."" [23] Due process requires that the law expressly declares unlawful, and punishes as such, the act for which the accused is held criminally liable. The void for vagueness doctrine is aimed precisely to enforce this fundamental constitutional right. Second , the Constitution provides that ""[I]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall x x x enjoy the right x x x to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him."" [24] This right of the accused requires that the Information states the particular act the accused committed in violation of a specific provision of a law defining such act a crime. A blanket and unconditional declaration that any violation of an elaborate and detailed law is a crime is too imprecise and indefinite , and fails to define with certitude and clarity what acts the law punishes as crimes. Such a shotgun approach to criminalizing human conduct is exactly what the void for vagueness doctrine outlaws, thus: That the terms of a penal statute creating a new offense must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties is a well-recognized requirement, consonant alike with the ordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law; and a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law. x x x The dividing line between what is lawful and unlawful conduct cannot be left to conjecture. The citizen cannot be held to answer charges based upon penal statutes whose mandates are so uncertain that they will reasonably admit of different constructions. A criminal statute cannot rest upon an uncertain foundation. The crime, and the elements constituting it, must be so clearly expressed that the ordinary person can intelligently choose, in advance, what course it is lawful for him to pursue. x x x [25] Section 45(j) is a penal statute. Penal statutes are construed strictly against the state and liberally in favor of the accused. The purpose is not to allow a guilty person to escape punishment through a technicality but to provide a precise definition of the prohibited act. [26] To constitute a crime, an act must come clearly within the spirit and letter of the penal statute. [27] Otherwise, the act is outside the coverage of the penal statute. An act is not a crime unless clearly made so by express provision of law . This Court has declared: Criminal statutes are to be construed strictly. No person should be brought within their terms who is not clearly within them, nor should any act be pronounced criminal which is not made clearly so by the statute . [28] (Emphasis supplied) Section 45(j) does not specify what provisions of RA No. 8189, if violated, carry a penal sanction. Section 45(j) merely states that ""violation of any of the provisions"" of RA No. 8189 is a crime. In addition to the provisions covered by Section 45(a) to (i), there are many other provisions of RA No. 8189 that are susceptible of violation. Section 45(j), however, does not specify which of these other provisions carry a penal sanction if violated. Thus, Section 45(j) fails to satisfy the requirement that for an act to be a crime it must clearly be made a crime by express provision of law. The penal provisions of the Omnibus Election Code [29] (Code) are instructive. Section 261 of the Code enumerates what are the specific prohibited acts which constitute election offenses. Section 262 [30] penalizes "" Other election offenses "" by specifying the specific sections of the Code the violation of which also constitutes election offenses. There is no room for guesswork as to what provisions the violation of which constitutes crimes. There is ""fair notice"" to all citizens of what acts are prohibited, and what acts are permitted, under the Code. Law enforcers have no discretion to choose what provisions are prohibited as criminal acts. Judges know with certainty what provisions of the Code carry penal sanctions. This is not the case with Section 45(j) of RA No. 8189. Indisputably, Section 45(j) is so vague that it fails to give ""fair notice"" to ordinary citizens as to what conduct is a crime and what conduct is lawful under Section 45(j). Section 45(j) is also so vague that it fails to define the prohibited acts in a precise and clear manner, allowing law enforcers to enforce it arbitrarily while leaving courts no standard by which to adjudge the guilt of a person accused of violating it. This substantial vagueness in Section 45(j) violates the due process clause. I therefore vote to declare Section 45(j) of RA No. 8189 UNCONSTITUTIONAL , and to GRANT the petition.

NO. 170823. March 27, 2007 ] DEPARTMENT OF AGRARIAN REFORM, REP. BY OIC-SECRETARY NASSER C. PANGANDAMAN, PETITIONER, VS. OROVILLE DEVELOPMENT CORP., REP. BY ANTONIO H. TIU AND  WALDO G. REBOLOS, RESPONDENT. D E C I S I O N TINGA, J.: The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) assails the Amended Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals dated July 18, 2005, which declared the 48.8939-hectare property subject of this case as not covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), and its Resolution [2] dated November 15, 2005, which denied the DAR's motion for reconsideration. The undisputed facts are as follows: On July 7, 1997, petitioner [Oroville Development Corporation] applied with DAR Regional Office No. X for exclusion of the subject property from CARP coverage pursuant to DAR Administrative Order No. 06, s. of 1994, entitled ""Guidelines for the Issuance of Exemption Clearance Based on Section 3 [c] of Republic Act (RA) No. 6657 and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Opinion No. 44, Series of 1990."" According to petitioner, the property was reclassified into residential use prior to June 15, 1998, the date of effectivity of RA [No.] 6557, per Town Plan and Zoning Ordinance No. 880,s. of 1979 of Cagayan de Oro City, as approved by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) on September 24, 1980, and covering tax declarations. On May 25, 1998, DAR Secretary Ernesto D. Garilao issued an Order denying petitioner's application. The dispositive portion thereof reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, Order is hereby issued DENYING the exemption application and DECLARING that the 48.8939 hectare agricultural land embraced by TCT numbers [sic] T-85121, T-85135, and T-104365 located at Maitum, Upper Puerto, Cagayan de Oro City as COVERED by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARP). Petitioner failed in its move to reconsider the said May 25, 1998 Order, as shown in the Order issued by DAR Secretary Hernani A. Braganza on June 20, 2002, which decreed: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Motion for Reconsideration dated 10 June 1998 filed by applicant-movant Oroville Development Corporation, is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. The Order of the Secretary dated 25 May 1998 is hereby AFFIRMED in toto. Unfazed, petitioner elevated the DAR Orders to the Office of the President (OP). However, the OP rendered a Decision on June 27, 2003, as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the questioned Orders dated 25 May 1998 and 20 June 2002 of the DAR Secretary are hereby AFFIRMED and the instant appeal DISMISSED. Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied by the OP in its Resolution dated December 9, 2003. [3] On petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, the Court of Appeals was faced with the issue of whether the subject property is classified as agricultural as found by the DAR Secretary and affirmed by the Office of the President, or residential as alleged by respondent Oroville Development Corporation (Oroville). The appellate court initially declared in its Decision [4] dated March 16, 2005 that the subject property is agricultural on the basis of a later certification to this effect dated February 10, 1997 issued by the City Development Coordinator of the City Planning and Development Office which superseded the Certification dated November 22, 1993 issued by the same authority. Upon Oroville's motion for reconsideration, however, the Court of Appeals set aside its earlier Decision and ruled that the subject property has been reclassified as residential and therefore beyond the coverage of CARP.  This time, the appellate court gave credence to three (3) Zoning Certifications dated July 23, 2004 issued by the Assistant City Development Coordinator of the City Planning and Development Office to the effect that the subject property is within the city's potential growth areas for urban expansion.  According to the Court of Appeals, these certifications were not considered by the court in the resolution of Oroville's petition because they were not yet in existence when the petition was filed on February 24, 2004. The Court of Appeals denied reconsideration. In its Petition for Review [5] dated January 9, 2006, the DAR seeks the reversal of the appellate court's Amended Decision, arguing that the latter precipitately relied on the Zoning Certifications issued by the City Planning and Development Office and erroneously assumed that a local government unit such as Cagayan de Oro City has unconditional authority to classify and reclassify lands within its territorial jurisdiction. The DAR points out that the Assistant City Development Coordinator herself clarified, in a letter dated December 2, 2005, that the zoning classification of the subject property remains to be agricultural considering that the 1979 Zoning Code of Cagayan de Oro City is still in force.  Further, the Zoning Certifications do not qualify as newly discovered evidence because the supposed basis for these certifications, City Ordinance No. 7959, was already in effect in 2001, years before the Court of Appeals rendered its original Decision in 2005. The DAR maintains that the Certification dated February 10, 1997 to the effect that the subject property is agricultural should be upheld because it was based not only on a zoning ordinance but, more importantly, was approved prior to the effectivity of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform  Law (CARL) in 1988, by the then Human Settlements Regulatory Commission, now the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, the national agency then charged with the classification and reclassification of lands. Oroville centers its Comment [6] dated May 11, 2006 on the argument that the subject property had been classified as residential prior to the effectivity of the CARL and the Local Government Code (LGC). The DAR's insistence, invoking Sec. 20 of the LGC, that further approval by the national agency concerned is essential in order to effect the reclassification of the subject property from agricultural to residential because City Ordinance No. 7959 which was made the basis for the Zoning Certifications issued by the City Planning and Development Office was enacted only in 2001, is therefore erroneous.  Moreover, Oroville avers that the subject property has been consistently declared as residential land as shown in previous tax declarations. In its Reply [7] dated August 8, 2006, the DAR asserts that tax declarations are not conclusive of the nature of the property for zoning purposes. The question upon which the resolution of this case turns is whether the subject property is agricultural or residential based on Cagayan de Oro City's zoning ordinances. The conflicting certifications issued by the City Planning and Development Office, which has unquestioned primary jurisdiction to rule on matters of classification of lands within its territorial jurisdiction, need to be scrutinized in order to arrive at a definitive ruling. A review of the case's antecedents shows that in its Orders dated May 25, 1998 and June 20, 2002, the DAR declared the property to be agricultural on the basis primarily of the Certification dated February 10, 1997 prepared by the City Planning and Development Office which states ""that Lot No. 184398 (F-V-12713), Lot No. H-4321 and Lot No. H-16-4, located at Upper Puerto, this City, is within AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT per provision of Section 22-A of the 1994 Certified Ordinance of the City of Cagayan de Oro."" [8] Oroville claims, however, that the earlier Certification dated November 22, 1993, which states ""that Lot No. 19801 Cad. 369-0 located at Puerto, this City is within Residential classification per Section 9; Article IV of Zoning Ordinance, Ordinance No. 880 series of 1979,"" [9] should prevail over the February 10, 1997 Certification. It is at once evident that the 1993 certification pertains generally to a lot located in Puerto, while the 1997 certification makes specific reference to Upper Puerto . This distinction gains significance in light of the DAR's finding, in its Order dated June 20, 2002, that Section 9(b), Article IV of Ordinance No. 880, Series of 1979, does classify lands in Barangay Puerto as within the residential area, but explicitly provides that lands within Barangay Upper Puerto , among others, are within the agricultural zone. [10] It is also significant to note that, as mentioned in the assailed Amended Decision, the 1993 certification pertains only to Lot No. 19801 Cad. 369-0 which covers two portions of the subject land, namely: the portion encompassed by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) Nos. T-85121 and T-104365. [11] In contrast, as detailed in the DAR Secretary's Order dated June 20, 2002, the 1997 certification is more encompassing as it concerns all the parcels subject of this case, i.e., the parcels covered by TCT Nos. T-85121, T-104365 and T-85135. [12] Moreover, an actual field verification conducted by the DAR Region X Regional Center for Land Use Policy, Planning and Implementation in the presence of Oroville's representative, Atty. Marilou Aban, revealed that about a hundred persons composed of potential farmer-beneficiaries and indigenous peoples reside in the subject property and that the same is devoted to crops such as corn and cassava, and gemelina and fruit trees. We cannot simply brush aside the DAR's pronouncements regarding the status of the subject property as not exempt from CARP coverage considering that the DAR has unquestionable technical expertise on these matters. [13] Factual findings of administrative agencies are generally accorded respect and even finality by this Court, if such findings are supported by substantial evidence, a situation that obtains in this case. The factual findings of the Secretary of Agrarian Reform who, by reason of his official position, has acquired expertise in specific matters within his jurisdiction, deserve full respect and, without justifiable reason, ought not to be altered, modified or reversed. [14] More so, because the DAR's findings have gone up the ladder of administrative process and have been affirmed by the Office of the President. We certainly consider it error for the appellate court to overturn its own Decision on the basis solely of the Zoning Certifications dated July 23, 2004 also issued by the City Planning and Development Office to the effect that in accordance with City Ordinance No. 7959, the subject property ""x x x is located within Potential Growth Areas for Urban Expansion. x x x "" [15] The certifications were only attached to Oroville's Reply to DAR's Comment on the petition filed with the Court of Appeals. While it is true, as the appellate court held, that the certifications dated July 23, 2004 could not have been attached to the petition which was filed on February 24, 2004 as they were not in existence then, it does not escape notice that the zoning ordinance upon which the certifications were based was passed as early as 2001.  By the exercise of reasonable diligence, Oroville could have easily secured these certifications in time for the filing of its petition and the appellate court could have already then passed upon their value. Moreover, these certifications have been clarified by the same person who issued them in a letter [16] dated December 2, 2005, to the effect that the certifications state only that the properties mentioned are within the potential growth areas for urban expansion under the city's Comprehensive Land Use Plan and do not affect the zoning classification of the properties as agricultural in accordance with the city's Zoning Code. Indeed, the zoning certifications should be construed to mean simply that under the city's Comprehensive Land Use Plan, the subject property is categorized as a ""potential growth area"" for whatever purpose the city would deem suitable.  The term ""potential growth area"" is not a land classification category.  That the subject property was identified as a ""potential growth area"" does not denote that it has been reclassified as a mineral, forest, residential, commercial or industrial land to qualify it for exemption from CARP coverage. To summarize, in order to be exempt from CARP coverage, the subject property must have been classified as industrial/residential before June 15, 1988. [17] In this case, the DAR's examination of the zoning ordinances and certifications pertaining to the subject property, as well as its field investigation, disclosed that the same remains to be agricultural.  The Zoning Certifications to the effect that the land is within the city's potential growth area for urban expansion are inconsequential as they do not reflect the present classification of the land but merely its intended land use. IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the instant petition is GRANTED. The Amended Decision dated July 18, 2005 and Resolution dated November 15, 2005 of the Court of Appeals are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated March 16, 2005 is REINSTATED.  No pronouncement as to costs. SO ORDERED. DANTE O.

BLUE RIDGE MINERAL CORPORATION AND CELESTIAL NICKEL MINING EXPLORATION CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N VELASCO JR., J.: The Case Before us are four (4) petitions. The first is a Petition for Review on Certiorari [1] under Rule 45 docketed as G.R. No. 169080 , wherein petitioner Celestial Nickel Mining Exploration Corporation (Celestial) seeks to set aside the April 15, 2005 Decision [2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 87931. The CA affirmed the November 26, 2004 Resolution of the Mines Adjudication Board (MAB) in MAB Case Nos. 056-97 and 057-97 (DENR Case Nos. 97-01 and 97-02), upholding the authority of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Secretary to grant and cancel mineral agreements. Also assailed is the August 3, 2005 Resolution [3] of the CA denying the Motion for Reconsideration of the assailed Decision. The second is a Petition for Certiorari [4] under Rule 65 docketed as G.R. No. 172936 , wherein petitioner Blue Ridge Mineral Corporation (Blue Ridge) seeks to annul and set aside the action of then Secretary Michael T. Defensor, in his capacity as DENR Secretary, approving and signing two Mineral Production Sharing Agreements (MPSAs) in favor of Macroasia Corporation (Macroasia) denominated as MPSA Nos. 220-2005-IVB and 221-2005-IVB. And the third and fourth are petitions for review on certiorari [5] under Rule 45 docketed as G.R. No. 176226 and G.R. No. 176319 , wherein petitioners Celestial and Macroasia, respectively, seek to set aside the May 18, 2006 Decision [6] of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 90828.  The CA reversed and set aside the November 26, 2004 and July 12, 2005 Resolutions of the MAB, and reinstated the October 24, 2000 Decision in MAB Case Nos. 056-97 and 057-97, granting Blue Ridge the prior and preferential right to file its application over the mining claims of Macroasia. These petitions likewise seek to set aside the January 19, 2007 Resolution [7] of the CA denying petitioners' motions for reconsideration of the assailed Decision. Through our July 5, 2006 Resolution, [8] we consolidated the first two cases. While in our subsequent April 23, 2007 [9] and July 11, 2007 [10] Resolutions, we consolidated the four cases as they arose from the same facts. The undisputed facts as found by the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 87931 are as follows: On September 24, 1973, the then Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources and Infanta Mineral and Industrial Corporation (Infanta) entered into a Mining Lease Contract (V-1050) for a term of 25 years up to September 23, 1998 for mining lode claims covering an area of 216 hectares at Sitio Linao, Ipilan, Brooke's Point, Palawan. The mining claims of Infanta covered by lode/lease contracts were as follows: Contract No. Area Date of Issuance LLC-V-941 18 hectares January 17, 1972 LC-V-1050 216 hectares September 24, 1973 LLC-V-1060 16 hectares October 30, 1973 LLC-V-1061 144 hectares October 30, 1973 LLC-V-1073 144 hectares April 18, 1973 MLC-MRD-52 306 hectares April 26, 1978 MLC-MRC-53 72 hectares April 26, 1978 Infanta's corporate name was changed to Cobertson Holdings Corporation on January 26, 1994 and subsequently to its present name, Macroasia Corporation, on November 6, 1995. Sometime in 1997, Celestial filed a Petition to Cancel the subject mining lease contracts and other mining claims of Macroasia including those covered by Mining Lease Contract No. V-1050, before the Panel of Arbitrators (POA) of the Mines and Geo-Sciences Bureau (MGB) of the DENR.  The petition was docketed as DENR Case No. 97-01. Blue Ridge, in an earlier letter-petition, also wrote the Director of Mines to seek cancellation of mining lease contracts and other mining rights of Macroasia and another entity, Lebach Mining Corporation (Lebach), in mining areas in Brooke's Point. The petition was eventually docketed as DENR Case No. 97-02. Celestial is the assignee of 144 mining claims covering such areas contiguous to Infanta's (now Macroasia) mining lode claims.  Said area was involved in protracted administrative disputes with Infanta (now Macroasia), Lecar & Sons, Inc., and Palawan Nickel Mining Corporation.  Celestial also holds an MPSA with the government which covers 2,835 hectares located at Ipilan/Maasin, Brooke's Point, Palawan and two pending applications covering another 4,040 hectares in Barangay Mainit also in Brooke's Point. Celestial sought the cancellation of Macroasia's lease contracts on the following grounds:  (1) the nonpayment of Macroasia of required occupational fees and municipal taxes; (2) the non-filing of Macroasia of Affidavits of Annual Work Obligations; (3) the failure of Macroasia to provide improvements on subject mining claims; (4) the concentration of Macroasia on logging; (5) the encroachment, mining, and extraction by Macroasia of nickel ore from Celestial's property; (6) the ability of Celestial to subject the mining areas to commercial production; and (7) the  willingness of Celestial to pay fees and back taxes of Macroasia. In the later part of the proceedings, Macroasia intervened in the case and submitted its position paper refuting the grounds for cancellation invoked by Celestial. [11] The Ruling of the Panel of Arbitrators in DENR Case Nos. 97-01 and 97-02 Based on the records of the Bureau of Mines and findings of the field investigations, the POA found that Macroasia and Lebach not only automatically abandoned their areas/mining claims but likewise had lost all their rights to the mining claims. The POA granted the petition of Celestial to cancel the following Mining Lease Contracts of Macroasia: LLC-V-941, LLC-V-1050, LLC-V-1060, LLC-V-1061, LLC-V-1073, MLC-MRD-52, and MLC-MRC-53; and found the claims of the others indubitably meritorious.  It gave Celestial the preferential right to Macroasia's mining areas. [12] It upheld Blue Ridge's petition regarding DENR Case No. 97-02, but only as against the Mining Lease Contract areas of Lebach (LLC-V-1153, LLC-V-1154, and LLC-V-1155), and the said leased areas were declared automatically abandoned.  It gave Blue Ridge priority right to the aforesaid Lebach's areas/mining claims. [13] Blue Ridge and Macroasia appealed before the MAB, and the cases were docketed as MAB Case Nos. 056-97 and 057-97, respectively. Lebach did not file any notice of appeal with the required memorandum of appeal; thus, with respect to Lebach, the above resolution became final and executory. The Rulings of the Mines Adjudication Board in MAB Case Nos. 056-97 and 057-97 (DENR Case Nos. 97-01 and 97-02) The MAB resolved the issues of timeliness and perfection of Macroasia's appeal; Macroasia's abandonment of its mining claims; and the preferential right over the abandoned mining claims of Macroasia. Conformably with Section 51 of Consolidated Mines Administrative Order (CMAO) [14] implementing Presidential Decree No. (PD) 463 [15] and our ruling in Medrana v. Office of the President (OP), [16] the MAB affirmed the POA findings that Macroasia abandoned its mining claims.  The MAB found that Macroasia did not comply with its work obligations from 1986 to 1991. It based its conclusion on the field verifications conducted by the MGB, Region IV and validated by the Special Team tasked by the MAB. [17] However, contrary to the findings of the POA, the MAB found that it was Blue Ridge that had prior and preferential rights over the mining claims of Macroasia, and not Celestial. Thus, on October 24, 2000, the MAB promulgated its Decision upholding the Decision of the POA to cancel the Mining Lode/Lease Contracts of Macroasia; declaring abandoned the subject mining claims; and opening the mining area with prior and preferential rights to Blue Ridge for mining applications, subject to strict compliance with the procedure and requirements provided by law. In case Blue Ridge defaults, Celestial could exercise the secondary priority and preferential rights, and subsequently, in case Celestial also defaults, other qualified applicants could file. [18] Both Celestial and Macroasia moved for reconsideration. [19] Celestial asserted that it had better rights than Blue Ridge over the mining claims of Macroasia as it had correctly filed its petition, and filed its MPSA application after Macroasia's lease contract expired on January 17, 1997 and after the POA's resolution was issued on September 1, 1997.  Moreover, it argued that priority was not an issue when the contested area had not yet been declared abandoned.  Thus, Blue Ridge's MPSA application filed on June 17, 1996 had no effect and should not be considered superior since Macroasia's lease contracts were still valid and subsisting and could not have been canceled by Macroasia's mere failure to perform annual work obligations and pay corresponding royalties/taxes to the government. Macroasia, in its Motion for Reconsideration, reiterated that it did not abandon its mining claims, and even if mining was not listed among its purposes in its amended Articles of Incorporation, its mining activities were acts that were only ultra vires but were ratified as a secondary purpose by its stockholders in subsequent amendments of  its Articles of Incorporation. Before the MAB could resolve the motions for reconsideration, on March 16, 2001, Macroasia filed its Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration [20] questioning the jurisdiction of the POA in canceling mining lease contracts and mining claims.  Macroasia averred that the power and authority to grant, cancel, and revoke mineral agreements is exclusively lodged with the DENR Secretary. Macroasia further pointed out that in arrogating upon itself such power, the POA whimsically and capriciously discarded the procedure on conferment of mining rights laid down in Republic Act No. (RA) 7942, The Philippine Mining Act of 1995 , and DENR Administrative Order No. (AO) 96-40, [21] and perfunctorily and improperly awarded its mining rights to Blue Ridge and Celestial. Subsequently, on November 26, 2004, the MAB issued a Resolution [22] vacating its October 24, 2000 Decision, holding that neither the POA nor the MAB had the power to revoke a mineral agreement duly entered into by the DENR Secretary, ratiocinating that there was no provision giving the POA and MAB the concurrent power to manage or develop mineral resources. The MAB further held that the power to cancel or revoke a mineral agreement was exclusively lodged with the DENR Secretary; that a petition for cancellation is not a mining dispute under the exclusive jurisdiction of the POA pursuant to Sec. 77 of RA 7942; and that the POA could only adjudicate claims or contests during the MPSA application and not when the claims and leases were already granted and subsisting. Moreover, the MAB held that there was no abandonment by Macroasia because the DENR Secretary had not decided to release Macroasia from its obligations. The Secretary may choose not to release a contractor from its obligations on grounds of public interest.  Thus, through its said resolution, the MAB rendered its disposition, as follows: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed Decision of October 24, 2000 is hereby VACATED. The seven (7) mining lease contracts of Macroasia Corporation (formerly Infanta Mineral & Industrial Corporation) are DECLARED SUBSISTING prior to their expirations without prejudice to any Decision or Order that the Secretary may render on the same.  NO PREFERENTIAL RIGHT over the same mining claims is accorded to Blue Ridge Mineral Corporation or Celestial Nickel Mining Exploration Corporation also without prejudice to the determination by the Secretary over the matter at the proper time. [23] After the issuance of the MAB Resolution, Celestial and Blue Ridge went through divergent paths in their quest to protect their individual interests. On January 10, 2005, Celestial assailed the November 26, 2004 MAB Resolution before the CA in a petition for review [24] under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. The petition entitled Celestial Nickel Mining Exploration Corporation v. Macroasia Corporation, et al. was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 87931. On the other hand, Blue Ridge first filed a Motion for Reconsideration [25] which was denied. [26] On August 26, 2005, Blue Ridge questioned the MAB's November 26, 2004 and July 12, 2005 Resolutions before the CA in a petition for review [27] entitled Blue Ridge Mineral Corporation v. Mines Adjudication Board, et al. docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 90828. CA-G.R. SP No. 87931 filed by Celestial was heard by the 12th Division of the CA; while Blue Ridge's CA-G.R. SP No. 90828 was heard by the Special 10th Division. Ironically, the two divisions rendered two (2) diametrically opposing decisions. The Ruling of the Court of Appeals Twelfth Division On April 15, 2005, in CA-G.R. SP No. 87931, the CA 12th Division affirmed the November 26, 2004 MAB Resolution which declared Macroasia's seven mining lease contracts as subsisting; rejected Blue Ridge's claim for preferential right over said mining claims; and upheld  the exclusive authority of the DENR Secretary to approve, cancel, and revoke mineral agreements. The CA also denied Celestial's Motion for Reconsideration [28] of the assailed August 3, 2005 Resolution. [29] Hence, Celestial filed its Petition for Review on Certiorari [30] docketed as G.R. No. 169080 ,before this Court. The Ruling of the Court of Appeals Special Tenth Division On May 18, 2006, the CA Special 10th Division in CA-G.R. SP No. 90828 granted Blue Ridge's petition; reversed and set aside the November 26, 2004 and July 12, 2005 Resolutions of the MAB; and reinstated the October 24, 2000 Decision in MAB Case Nos. 056-97 and 057-97.  The Special Tenth Division canceled Macroasia's lease contracts; granted Blue Ridge prior and preferential rights; and treated the cancellation of a mining lease agreement as a mining dispute within the exclusive jurisdiction of the POA under Sec. 77 of RA 7942, explaining that the power to resolve mining disputes, which is the greater power, necessarily includes the lesser power to cancel mining agreements. On February 20, 2006, Celestial filed a Most Urgent Motion for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order/Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction/Mandatory Injunction [31] to defer and preclude the issuance of MPSA to Macroasia by the MGB and the DENR Secretary.  We denied this motion in our February 22, 2006 Resolution. [32] Upon inquiry with the DENR, Blue Ridge discovered that sometime in December 2005 two MPSAs, duly approved and signed by the DENR Secretary, had been issued in favor of Macroasia.  Thus, we have the instant Petition for Certiorari [33] filed by Blue Ridge docketed as G.R. No. 172936 under Rule 65, seeking to invalidate the two MPSAs issued to Macroasia. In the meantime, on June 7, 2006, Celestial filed its Motion for Partial Reconsideration [34] of the May 18, 2006 CA Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 90828, while Macroasia filed its motion for reconsideration of the same CA decision on July 7, 2006. The motions were denied in the assailed January 19, 2007 CA Resolution.  Hence, on March 8, 2007, Celestial filed the third petition [35] docketed as G.R. No. 176226 , assailing the CA's May 18, 2006 Decision and January 19, 2007 Resolution, insofar as these granted Blue Ridge's prior and preferential rights.  While on March 9, 2007, Macroasia filed the fourth petition [36] docketed as G.R. No. 176319 , also assailing the CA's May 18, 2006 Decision and January 19, 2007 Resolution. The Issues In G.R. No. 169080 , petitioner Celestial raises the following issues for our consideration: (1) Whether or not Macroasia, for reasons of public policy is estopped from assailing the alleged lack of jurisdiction of the Panel of Arbitrators and the Mines Adjudication Board only after receiving an adverse judgment therefrom? [sic] (2) Whether or not it is only the Secretary of the DENR who has the jurisdiction to cancel mining contracts and privileges? [sic] (3) Whether or not a petition for the cancellation of a mining lease contract or privilege is a mining dispute within the meaning of the law? [sic] (4) Whether or not Infanta's (Macroasia) mining lease contract areas were deemed abandoned warranting the cancellation of the lease contracts and the opening of the areas to other qualified applicants? [sic] (5) Whether or not Macroasia/Infanta had lost its right to participate in this case after it failed to seasonably file its appeal and after its lease contracts had been declared abandoned and expired without having been renewed by the government? [sic] (6) Whether or not Celestial has the preferential right to apply for    the 23 DE LARA claims which were included in Infanta's (Macroasia) expired lease contract (LLC-V-941) and the other    areas declared as lapsed or abandoned by MGB-Region 4 and    the Panel of Arbitrators? [37] [sic] In G.R. No. 172936 , petitioner Blue Ridge raises the following grounds for the allowance of the petition: I At the outset, the instant petition must be given due course and taken cognizance of by the Honorable Court considering that exceptional and compelling circumstances justify the availment of the instant petition and the call for the exercise of the Honorable Court's primary jurisdiction. The exploration, development and utilization of minerals,   petroleum and other mineral oils are imbued with public interest.  The action of then Secretary Defensor, maintained and    continued by public respondent Secretary Reyes, was tainted with grave abuse of discretion, has far-reaching consequences   because of the magnitude of the effect created thereby. The issues in the instant petition have already been put to fore    by Celestial with the First Division of the Honorable Court, and hence, this circumstance justifies the cognizance by the   Honorable Court of the instant petition. II It was grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack and/or excess of jurisdiction for then Secretary Defensor to have issued the subject MPSAs in favor of private respondent Macroasia, considering that: Non-compliance of the mandatory requirements by private respondent Macroasia prior to approval of the subject MPSAs   should have precluded then Secretary Defensor from approving    subject MPSAs. Petitioner Blue Ridge has the prior and preferential right to file its mining application over the mining claims covered by the subject MPSAs, pursuant to the Decision dated 24 October 2000 of the Board and as affirmed by the Decision dated 18 May 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 90828. [38] In G.R. No. 176226 , petitioner Celestial ascribes the following errors to the CA for our consideration: (1) That in reinstating and adopting as its own the Decision of the Mine Adjudication Board affirming the abandonment and cancellation of the mining areas/claims of Macroasia (Infanta) but awarding the prior or preferential rights to Blue Ridge, the Hon. Court of Appeals had decided a question of substance in a way not in accord with the Law (RA 7942) or with the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court; in other words, errors of law had been committed by the Hon. Court of Appeals in granting preferential rights to Blue Ridge; (2) That the Hon. Court of Appeals has so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings or so far sanctioned such departure by the Mines Adjudication Board in its Decision of May 18, 2006 and Resolution of January 19, 2007 because: (A)  The findings of fact of the Hon. Court of Appeals are contradictory or inconsistent with the findings of the Panel of Arbitrators; (B)  There is grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Hon. Court of Appeals in its appreciation of the facts, the evidence and the law thereby leading it to make the erroneous conclusion that Blue Ridge, not Celestial, is entitled to the Award of prior/preferential rights over the mining areas declared as abandoned by Macroasia; (C)  There is likewise, a grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Hon. Court of Appeals in that the said Court did not even consider some of the issues raised by Celestial; (D)  That the findings of the Hon. Court of Appeals are mere conclusions not supported by substantial evidence and without citation of the specific evidence upon which they are based; they were arrived at arbitrarily or in disregard of contradiction of the evidence on record and findings of the Panel of Arbitrators in the Resolution of September 1, 1997; (E)  That the findings of the Hon. Court of Appeals are premised on the absence of evidence but such findings are contradicted by the evidence on record and are violative of the provisions of RA 7942 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations. [39] In G.R. No. 176319 , petitioner Macroasia raises the following grounds for the allowance of the petition: I. The Court of Appeals (Special Tenth Division) should have dismissed the Petition of Blue Ridge outright since the issues, facts and matters involved in the said Petition are identical to those which had already been painstakingly passed upon, reviewed and resolved by the Court of Appeal's Twelfth Division in CA-G.R. SP No. 87931 II. The Court of Appeals (Special Tenth Division) gravely erred in denying Macroasia's Motion to Inhibit Associate Justice Rosmari Carandang from hearing and deciding the Petition III. There were no factual nor legal bases for the Court of Appeals to rule that Macroasia had waived its right to question the jurisdiction of the Mines Adjudication Board IV. Republic Act No. 7942 contains provisions which unequivocally indicate that only the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources has the power and authority to cancel mining lease agreements V. The Court of Appeals (Special Tenth Division) gravely erred in perfunctorily transferring Macroasia's mining lease agreements to Blue Ridge without observing the required procedure nor providing any basis therefor [40] The Court's Ruling The petitions under G.R. Nos. 169080, 172936, and 176226 are bereft of merit, while the petition under G.R. No. 176319 is meritorious. The pith of the controversy, upon which the other issues are hinged is, who has authority and jurisdiction to cancel existing mineral agreements under RA 7942 in relation to PD 463 and pertinent rules and regulations. G.R. Nos. 169080, 176226 and 176319 We will jointly tackle G.R. Nos. 169080, 176266, and 176319 as the issues and arguments of these three are inextricably intertwined. Core Issue:  Jurisdiction over Cancellation of Mineral Agreements Petitioner Celestial maintains that while the jurisdiction to approve mining lease contracts or mineral agreements is conferred on the DENR Secretary, Sec. 77(a) of RA 7942 by implication granted to the POA and MAB the authority to cancel existing mining lease contracts or mineral agreements. On the other hand, respondent Macroasia strongly asserts that it is the DENR Secretary who has the exclusive and primary jurisdiction to grant and cancel existing mining lease contracts; thus, the POA and MAB have no jurisdiction to cancel much less to grant any preferential rights to other mining firms. Before we resolve this core issue of jurisdiction over cancellation of mining lease contracts, we first need to look back at previous mining laws pertinent to this issue. Under PD 463, The Mineral Resources Development Decree of 1974 , which took effect on May 17, 1974, applications for lease of mining claims were required to be filed with the Director of the Bureau of Mines, within two (2) days from the date of their recording. [41] Sec. 40 of PD 463 provided that if no adverse claim was filed within (15) days after the first date of publication, it was conclusively presumed that no adverse claim existed and thereafter no objection from third parties to the grant of the lease could be heard, except protests pending at the time of publication. The Secretary would then approve and issue the corresponding mining lease contract.  In case of any protest or adverse claim relating to any mining claim and lease application, Secs. 48 and 50 of PD 463 prescribed the procedure. Under Sec. 48, the protest should be filed with the Bureau of Mines.  Under Sec. 50, any party not satisfied with the decision or order of the Director could, within five (5) days from receipt of the decision or order, appeal to the Secretary. The decisions of the Secretary were likewise appealable within five (5) days from receipts by the affected party to the President of the Philippines whose decision shall be final and executory. PD 463 was, however, silent as to who was authorized to cancel the mineral agreements. On July 10, 1987, President Corazon C. Aquino issued Executive Order No. (EO) 211.  Under Sec. 2 of EO 211, the processing, evaluation, and approval of all mining applications, declarations of locations, operating agreements, and service contracts were governed by PD 463, as amended. EO 211 likewise did not contain any provision on the authority to cancel operating agreements and service contracts. On July 25, 1987, EO 279 was issued by President Aquino. It authorized the DENR Secretary to negotiate and enter into, for and in behalf of the Government, joint venture, co-production, or production-sharing agreements for the exploration, development, and utilization of mineral resources with any Filipino citizen, corporation, or association, at least 60% of whose capital was owned by Filipino citizens. [42] The contract or agreement was subject to the approval of the President. [43] With respect to contracts of foreign-owned corporations or foreign investors involving either technical or financial assistance for large-scale exploration, development, and utilization of minerals, the DENR Secretary could recommend approval of said contracts to the President. [44] EO 279 provided that PD 463 and its implementing rules and regulations, which were not inconsistent with EO 279, continued in force and effect. [45] Again, EO 279 was silent on the authority to cancel mineral agreements. RA 7942, The Philippine Mining Act of 1995 enacted on March 3, 1995, repealed the provisions of PD 463 inconsistent with RA 7942.  Unlike PD 463, where the application was filed with the Bureau of Mines Director, the applications for mineral agreements are now required to be filed with the Regional Director as provided by Sec. 29 of RA 7942. The proper filing gave the proponent the prior right to be approved by the Secretary and thereafter to be submitted to the President. The President shall provide a list to Congress of every approved mineral agreement within 30 days from its approval by the Secretary.  Again, RA 7942 is silent on who has authority to cancel the agreement. Compared to PD 463 where disputes were decided by the Bureau of Mines Director whose decisions were appealable to the DENR Secretary and then to the President, RA 7942 now provides for the creation of quasi-judicial bodies (POA and MAB) that would have jurisdiction over conflicts arising from the applications and mineral agreements.  Secs. 77, 78, and 79 lay down the procedure, thus: SEC. 77 .  Panel of Arbitrators .—There shall be a panel of arbitrators in the regional office of the Department composed of three (3) members, two (2) of whom must be members of the Philippine Bar in good standing and one [1] licensed mining engineer or a professional in a related field, and duly designated by the Secretary as recommended by the Mines and Geosciences Bureau Director.  Those designated as members of the panel shall serve as such in addition to their work in the Department without receiving any additional compensation.  As much as practicable, said members shall come from the different bureaus of the Department in the region.  The presiding officer thereof shall be selected by the drawing of lots.  His tenure as presiding officer shall be on a yearly basis. The members of the panel shall perform their duties and obligations in hearing and deciding cases until their designation is withdrawn or revoked by the Secretary.  Within thirty (30) working days, after the submission of the case by the parties for decision, the panel shall have exclusive and original jurisdiction to hear and decide on the following: (a) Disputes involving rights to mining areas ; (b) Disputes involving mineral agreements or permits ; (c) Disputes involving surface owners, occupants and claimholders/concessionaires; and (d) Disputes pending before the Bureau and the Department at the  date of the effectivity of this Act. SEC. 78 .  Appellate Jurisdiction .—The decision or order of the panel of arbitrators may be appealed by the party not satisfied thereto to the Mines Adjudication Board within fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof which must decide the case within thirty (30) days from submission thereof for decision. SEC. 79 .  Mines Adjudication Board.— The Mines Adjudication Board shall be composed of three (3) members. The Secretary shall be the chairman with the Director of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau and the Undersecretary for Operations of the Department as members thereof. x x x x A petition for review by certiorari and question of law may be filed by the aggrieved party with the Supreme Court within thirty (30) days from receipt of the order or decision of the Board. RA 7942 is also silent as to who is empowered to cancel existing lease contracts and mineral agreements. Meanwhile, in Southeast Mindanao Gold Mining Corp. v. MAB , we explained that the decision of the MAB can first be appealed, via a petition for review, to the CA before elevating the case to this Court. [46] After a scrutiny of the provisions of PD 463, EO 211, EO 279, RA 7942 and its implementing rules and regulations, executive issuances, and case law, we rule that the DENR Secretary, not the POA, has the jurisdiction to cancel existing mineral lease contracts or mineral agreements based on the following reasons: 1. The power of the DENR Secretary to cancel mineral agreements emanates from his administrative authority, supervision, management, and control over mineral resources under Chapter I, Title XIV of Book IV of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987, viz: Chapter 1—General Provisions Section 1. Declaration of Policy .—(1) The State shall ensure, for the benefit of the Filipino people, the full exploration and development as well as the judicious disposition, utilization, management, renewal and conservation of the country's forest, mineral , land, waters, fisheries, wildlife, off-shore areas and other natural resources x x x Sec. 2. Mandate .—(1) The Department of Environment and Natural Resources shall be primarily responsible for the implementation of the foregoing policy .  (2) It shall, subject to law and higher authority, be in charge of carrying out the State's constitutional mandate to control and supervise the exploration, development, utilization, and conservation of the country's natural resources. x x x x Sec. 4. Powers and Functions .—The Department shall: x x x x (2) Formulate, implement and supervise the implementation of the government's policies, plans, and programs pertaining to the management, conservation, development, use and replenishment of the country's natural resources ; x x x x (4) Exercise supervision and control over forest lands, alienable and disposable public lands, mineral resources x x x x x x x (12) Regulate the development, disposition, extraction, exploration and use of the country's forest, land, water and mineral resources ; (13) Assume responsibility for the assessment, development, protection, licensing and regulation as provided for by law, where applicable, of all energy and natural resources ; the regulation and monitoring of service contractors, licensees, lessees, and permit for the extraction, exploration, development and use of natural resources products ; x x x x x x x (15) Exercise exclusive jurisdiction on the management and disposition of all lands of the public domain x x x Chapter 2—The Department Proper x x x x Sec. 8. The Secretary .—The Secretary shall: x x x x (3) Promulgate rules, regulations and other issuances necessary in carrying out the Department's mandate, objectives, policies, plans, programs and projects . (4) Exercise supervision and control over all functions and activities of the Department ; (5) Delegate authority for the performance of any administrative or substantive function to subordinate officials of the Department x x x (Emphasis supplied.) It is the DENR, through the Secretary, that manages, supervises, and regulates the use and development of all mineral resources of the country.  It has exclusive jurisdiction over the management of all lands of public domain, which covers mineral resources and deposits from said lands.  It has the power to oversee, supervise, and police our natural resources which include mineral resources.  Derived from the broad and explicit powers of the DENR and its Secretary under the Administrative Code of 1987 is the power to approve mineral agreements and necessarily to cancel or cause to cancel said agreements. 2. RA 7942 confers to the DENR Secretary specific authority over mineral resources. Secs. 8 and 29 of RA 7942 pertinently provide: SEC. 8 . Authority of the Department. —The Department shall be the primary government agency responsible for the conservation, management, development, and proper use of the States mineral resources including those in reservations, watershed areas, and lands of the public domain. The Secretary shall have the authority to enter into mineral agreements on behalf of the Government upon the recommendation of the Director , promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement the intent and provisions of this Act. SEC. 29. Filing and approval of Mineral Agreements .—x x x. The filing of a proposal for a mineral agreement shall give the proponent the prior right to areas covered by the same. The proposed mineral agreement will be approved by the Secretary and copies thereof shall be submitted to the President. Thereafter, the President shall provide a list to Congress of every approved mineral agreement within thirty (30) days from its approval by the Secretary.  (Emphasis supplied.) Sec. 29 is a carry over of Sec. 40 of PD 463 which granted jurisdiction to the DENR Secretary to approve mining lease contracts on behalf of the government, thus: SEC. 40. Issuance of Mining Lease Contract .—If no adverse claim is filed within fifteen (15) days after the first date of publication, it shall be conclusively presumed that no such adverse claim exists and thereafter no objection from third parties to the grant of the lease shall be heard, except protest pending at the time of publication, and the Secretary shall approve and issue the corresponding mining lease x x x. To enforce PD 463, the CMAO containing the rules and regulations implementing PD 463 was issued. Sec. 44 of the CMAO provides: SEC. 44. Procedure for Cancellation .—Before any mining lease contract is cancelled for any cause enumerated in Section 43 above, the mining lessee shall first be notified in writing of such cause or causes, and shall be given an opportunity to be heard, and to show cause why the lease shall not be cancelled. If, upon investigation, the Secretary shall find the lessee to be in default, the former may warn the lessee, suspend his operations or cancel the lease contract (emphasis supplied). Sec. 4 of EO 279 provided that the provisions of PD 463 and its implementing rules and regulations, not inconsistent with the executive order, continue in force and effect. When RA 7942 took effect on March 3, 1995, there was no provision on who could cancel mineral agreements.  However, since the aforequoted Sec. 44 of the CMAO implementing PD 463 was not repealed by RA 7942 and DENR AO 96-40, not being contrary to any of the provisions in them, then it follows that Sec. 44 serves as basis for the DENR Secretary's authority to cancel mineral agreements. Since the DENR Secretary had the power to approve and cancel mineral agreements under PD 463, and the power to cancel them under the CMAO implementing PD 463, EO 211, and EO 279, then there was no recall of the power of the DENR Secretary under RA 7942.  Historically, the DENR Secretary has the express power to approve mineral agreements or contracts and the implied power to cancel said agreements. It is a well-established principle that in the interpretation of an ambiguous provision of law, the history of the enactment of the law may be used as an extrinsic aid to determine the import of the legal provision or the law. [47] History of the enactment of the statute constitutes prior laws on the same subject matter. Legislative history necessitates review of ""the origin, antecedents and derivation"" of the law in question to discover the legislative purpose or intent. [48] It can be assumed ""that the new legislation has been enacted as continuation of the existing legislative policy or as a new effort to perpetuate it or further advance it."" [49] We rule, therefore, that based on the grant of implied power to terminate mining or mineral contracts under previous laws or executive issuances like PD 463, EO 211, and EO 279, RA 7942 should be construed as a continuation of the legislative intent to authorize the DENR Secretary to cancel mineral agreements on account of violations of the terms and conditions thereof. 3. Under RA 7942, the power of control and supervision of the DENR Secretary over the MGB to cancel or recommend cancellation of mineral rights clearly demonstrates the authority of the DENR Secretary to cancel or approve the cancellation of mineral agreements. Under Sec. 9 of RA 7942, the MGB was given the power of direct supervision of mineral lands and resources, thus: Sec. 9. Authority of the Bureau .—The Bureau shall have direct charge in the administration and disposition of mineral lands and mineral resources and shall undertake geological, mining, metallurgical, chemical, and other researches as well as geological and mineral exploration surveys.  The Director shall recommend to the Secretary the granting of mineral agreements to duly qualified persons and shall monitor the compliance by the contractor of the terms and conditions of the mineral agreements .  The Bureau may confiscate surety, performance and guaranty bonds posted through an order to be promulgated by the Director.  The Director may deputize, when necessary, any member or unit of the Philippine National Police, barangay, duly registered nongovernmental organization (NGO) or any qualified person to police all mining activities.  (Emphasis supplied.) Corollary to the power of the MGB Director to recommend approval of mineral agreements is his power to cancel or recommend cancellation of mining rights covered by said agreements under Sec. 7 of DENR AO 96-40, containing the revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 7942.  Sec. 7 reads: Sec. 7.  Organization and Authority of the Bureau. x x x x The Bureau shall have the following authority, among others: To have direct charge in the administration and disposition of mineral land and mineral resources; x x x x To recommend to the Secretary the granting of mineral agreements or to endorse to the Secretary for action by the President the grant of FTAAs [Financial and Technical Assistance Agreements], in favor of qualified persons and to monitor compliance by the Contractor with the terms and conditions of the mineral agreements and FTAAs. To cancel or to recommend cancellation after due process, mining rights , mining applications and mining claims for non-compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations. It is explicit from the foregoing provision that the DENR Secretary has the authority to cancel mineral agreements based on the recommendation of the MGB Director.  As a matter of fact, the power to cancel mining rights can even be delegated by the DENR Secretary to the MGB Director.  Clearly, it is the Secretary, not the POA, that has authority and jurisdiction over cancellation of existing mining contracts or mineral agreements. 4. The DENR Secretary's power to cancel mining rights or agreements through the MGB can be inferred from Sec. 230, Chapter XXIV of DENR AO 96-40 on cancellation, revocation, and termination of a permit/mineral agreement/FTAA.  Sec. 230 provides: Section 230.  Grounds The following grounds for cancellation revocation and termination of a Mining Permit Mineral Agreement/FTAA. Violation of any of the terms and conditions of the Permits or Agreements; Nonpayment of taxes and fees due the government for two (2) consecutive years; and Falsehood or omission of facts in the application for exploration [or Mining] Permit Mineral Agreement/FTAA or other permits which may later, change or affect substantially the facts set forth in said statements. Though Sec. 230 is silent as to who can order the cancellation, revocation, and termination of a permit/mineral agreement/FTAA, it has to be correlated with the power of the MGB under Sec. 7 of AO 96-40 ""to cancel or to recommend cancellation, after due process, mining rights, mining applications and mining claims for noncompliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations.""  As the MGB is under the supervision of the DENR Secretary, then the logical conclusion is that it is the DENR Secretary who can cancel the mineral agreements and not the POA nor the MAB. 5. Celestial and Blue Ridge are not unaware of the stipulations in the Mining Lease Contract Nos. V-1050 and MRD-52, [50] the cancellation of which they sought from the POA.  It is clear from said lease contracts that the parties are the Republic of the Philippines represented by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (now DENR Secretary) as lessor, and Infanta (Macroasia) as lessee. Paragraph 18 of said lease contracts provides: Whenever the LESSEE fails to comply with any provision of [PD 463, and] Commonwealth Acts Nos. 137, 466 and 470, [both as amended,] and/or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any of the covenants therein, the LESSOR may declare this lease cancelled and, after having given thirty (30) days' notice in writing to the LESSEE, may enter and take possession of the said premises, and said lessee shall be liable for all unpaid rentals, royalties and taxes due the Government on the lease up to the time of the forfeiture or cancellation, in which event, the LESSEE hereby covenants and agrees to give up the possession of the property leased. (Emphasis supplied.) Thus, the government represented by the then Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (now the DENR Secretary) has the power to cancel the lease contracts for violations of existing laws, rules and regulations and the terms and conditions of the contracts. Celestial and Blue Ridge are now estopped from challenging the power and authority of the DENR Secretary to cancel mineral agreements. However, Celestial and Blue Ridge insist that the power to cancel mineral agreements is also lodged with the POA under the explicit provisions of Sec. 77 of RA 7942. This postulation is incorrect. Sec. 77 of RA 7942 lays down the jurisdiction of POA, to wit: Within thirty (30) days, after the submission of the case by the parties for the decision, the panel shall have exclusive and original jurisdiction to hear and decide the following: (a) Disputes involving rights to mining areas (b) Disputes involving mineral agreements or permits The phrase ""disputes involving rights to mining areas"" refers to any adverse claim, protest, or opposition to an application for mineral agreement. The POA therefore has the jurisdiction to resolve any adverse claim, protest, or opposition to a pending application for a mineral agreement filed with the concerned Regional Office of the MGB. This is clear from Secs. 38 and 41 of DENR AO 96-40, which provide: Sec.  38. x x x x Within thirty (30) calendar days from the last date of publication/posting/radio announcements, the authorized officer(s) of the concerned office(s) shall issue a certification(s) that the publication/posting/radio announcement have been complied with. Any adverse claim, protest or opposition shall be filed directly, within thirty (30) calendar days from the last date of publication/posting/radio announcement, with the concerned Regional Office or through any concerned PENRO or CENRO for filing in the concerned Regional Office for purposes of its resolution by the Panel of Arbitrators pursuant to the provisions of this Act and these implementing rules and regulations. Upon final resolution of any adverse claim, protest or opposition, the Panel of Arbitrators shall likewise issue a certification to that effect within five (5) working days from the date of finality of resolution thereof.  Where there is no adverse claim, protest or opposition, the Panel of Arbitrators shall likewise issue a Certification to that effect within five working days therefrom . x x x x No Mineral Agreement shall be approved unless the requirements under this Section are fully complied with and any adverse claim/protest/opposition is finally resolved by the Panel of Arbitrators . Sec.  41. x x x x Within fifteen (15) working days from the receipt of the Certification issued by the Panel of Arbitrators as provided in Section 38 hereof , the concerned Regional Director shall initially evaluate the Mineral Agreement applications in areas outside Mineral reservations.  He/She shall thereafter endorse his/her findings to the Bureau for further evaluation by the Director within fifteen (15) working days from receipt of forwarded documents.  Thereafter, the Director shall endorse the same to the secretary for consideration/approval within fifteen working days from receipt of such endorsement. In case of Mineral Agreement applications in areas with Mineral Reservations, within fifteen (15) working days from receipt of the Certification issued by the Panel of Arbitrators as provided for in Section 38 hereof , the same shall be evaluated and endorsed by the Director to the Secretary for consideration/approval within fifteen days from receipt of such endorsement. (Emphasis supplied.) It has been made clear from the aforecited provisions that the ""disputes involving rights to mining areas"" under Sec. 77(a) specifically refer only to those disputes relative to the applications for a mineral agreement or conferment of mining rights. The jurisdiction of the POA over adverse claims, protest, or oppositions to a mining right application is further elucidated by Secs. 219 and 43 of DENR AO 95-936, which read: Sec. 219 .  Filing of Adverse Claims/Conflicts/Oppositions .—Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 28, 43 and 57 above, any adverse claim, protest or opposition specified in said sections may also be filed directly with the Panel of Arbitrators within the concerned periods for filing such claim, protest or opposition as specified in said Sections. Sec. 43. Publication/Posting of Mineral Agreement Application .— x x x x The Regional Director or concerned Regional Director shall also cause the posting of the application on the bulletin boards of the Bureau, concerned Regional office(s) and in the concerned province(s) and municipality(ies), copy furnished the barangays where the proposed contract area is located once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks in a language generally understood in the locality.  After forty-five (45) days from the last date of publication/posting has been made and no adverse claim, protest or opposition was filed within the said forty-five (45) days, the concerned offices shall issue a certification that publication/posting has been made and that no adverse claim, protest or opposition of whatever nature has been filed. On the other hand, if there be any adverse claim, protest or opposition, the same shall be filed within forty-five (45) days from the last date of publication/posting, with the Regional Offices concerned, or through the Department's Community Environment and Natural Resources Officers (CENRO) or Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Officers (PENRO), to be filed at the Regional Office for resolution of the Panel of Arbitrators . However previously published valid and subsisting mining claims are exempted from posted/posting required under this Section. No mineral agreement shall be approved unless the requirements under this section are fully complied with and any opposition/adverse claim is dealt with in writing by the Director and resolved by the Panel of Arbitrators .  (Emphasis supplied.) These provisions lead us to conclude that the power of the POA to resolve any adverse claim, opposition, or protest relative to mining rights under Sec. 77(a) of RA 7942 is confined only to adverse claims, conflicts and oppositions relating to applications for the grant of mineral rights.  POA's jurisdiction is confined only to resolutions of such adverse claims, conflicts and oppositions and it has no authority to approve or reject said applications.  Such power is vested in the DENR Secretary upon recommendation of the MGB Director. Clearly, POA's jurisdiction over ""disputes involving rights to mining areas"" has nothing to do with the cancellation of existing mineral agreements. On the other hand, Celestial and Blue Ridge contend that POA has jurisdiction over their petitions for the cancellation of Macroasia's lease agreements banking on POA's jurisdiction over ""disputes involving mineral agreements or permits"" under Sec. 77 (b) of RA 7942. Such position is bereft of merit. As earlier discussed, the DENR Secretary, by virtue of his powers as administrative head of his department in charge of the management and supervision of the natural resources of the country under the 1987 Administrative Code, RA 7942, and other laws, rules, and regulations, can cancel a mineral agreement for violation of its terms, even without a petition or request filed for its cancellation, provided there is compliance with due process. Since the cancellation of the mineral agreement is approved by the DENR Secretary, then the recourse of the contractor is to elevate the matter to the OP pursuant to AO 18, Series of 1987 but not with the POA. Matched with the legal provisions empowering the DENR Secretary to cancel a mineral agreement is Sec. 77 (b) of RA 7942 which grants POA jurisdiction over disputes involving mineral agreements. A dispute is defined as ""a conflict or controversy; a conflict of claims or rights; an assertion of a right, claim or demand on one side; met by contrary claims or allegations on the other."" [51] It is synonymous to a cause of action which is ""an act or omission by which a party violates a right of another."" [52] A petition or complaint originating from a dispute can be filed or initiated only by a real party-in-interest.  The rules of court define a real party-in-interest as ""the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit or the party entitled to the avails of the suit."" [53] Every action, therefore, can only be prosecuted in the name of the real party-in-interest. [54] It has been explained that ""a real party-in-interest plaintiff is one who has a legal right, while a real party-in-interest-defendant is one who has a correlative legal obligation whose act or omission violates the legal right of the former."" [55] On the other hand, interest ""means material interest, an interest in issue and to be affected by the decree, as distinguished from mere interest in the question involved, or a mere incidental interest."" It is settled in this jurisdiction that ""one having no right or interest to protect cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the court as a party-plaintiff in an action."" [56] Real interest is defined as ""a present substantial interest, as distinguished from a mere expectancy, or a future, contingent, subordinate or consequential interest."" [57] From the foregoing, a petition for the cancellation of an existing mineral agreement covering an area applied for by an applicant based on the alleged violation of any of the terms thereof, is not a ""dispute"" involving a mineral agreement under Sec. 77 (b) of RA 7942.  It does not pertain to a violation by a party of the right of another.  The applicant is not a real party-in-interest as he does not have a material or substantial interest in the mineral agreement but only a prospective or expectant right or interest in the mining area.  He has no legal right to such mining claim and hence no dispute can arise between the applicant and the parties to the mineral agreement.  The court rules therefore that a petition for cancellation of a mineral agreement anchored on the breach thereof even if filed by an applicant to a mining claim, like Celestial and Blue Ridge, falls within the jurisdiction of the DENR Secretary and not POA.  Such petition is excluded from the coverage of the POA's jurisdiction over disputes involving mineral agreements under Sec. 77 (b) of RA 7942. Macroasia not estopped from raising the issue of jurisdiction on appeal On the related issue of estoppel, petitioner Celestial argues that Macroasia is estopped from raising and questioning the issue of the jurisdiction of the POA and MAB over the petition for cancellation of its mining lease contracts, when Macroasia raised it only in its Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration. We rule that the principle of estoppel does not apply. Indeed, Macroasia was not the one that initiated the instant case before the POA, and thus was not the one that invoked the jurisdiction of the POA.  Hence, on appeal, Macroasia is not precluded from raising the issue of jurisdiction as it may be invoked even on appeal. [58] As a matter of fact, a party can raise the issue of jurisdiction at any stage of the proceedings. Petitioner Celestial's reliance on Villela v. Gozun [59] to support the contention that the POA has jurisdiction to hear and decide a petition to cancel existing mining lease contracts, is misplaced.  In said case, we dismissed the petition on the ground of non-exhaustion of administrative remedies and disregarded judicial hierarchy as no compelling reason was shown to warrant otherwise.  While we pointed out the authority of the POA, there was no categorical pronouncement on the jurisdictional issue. No valid pronouncement of abandonment due to lack of jurisdiction over petition to cancel As we are not a trier of facts, we need not make any finding on the various investigations done by the MGB and MAB on the issue of Macroasia's non-compliance with its work obligations and nonpayment of taxes and fees.  Verily, the law does not impose automatic cancellation of an existing mining lease contract, as it is a question of fact which must be determined by the MGB which can recommend the cancellation of the mineral or lease agreements to the DENR Secretary.  Be that as it may, since the POA and MAB have no jurisdiction over the petition for cancellation of existing mining lease contracts of Macroasia, they could not have made any binding pronouncement that Macroasia had indeed abandoned the subject mining claims.  Besides, it is the DENR Secretary who has the authority to cancel Macroasia's existing mining lease contracts whether on grounds of abandonment or any valid grounds for cancellation. Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 90828 not in accord with the law With our resolution of the issue on the lack of jurisdiction of the POA and the MAB over petitions to cancel existing mining lease contracts or mineral agreements, it is thus clear that the May 18, 2006 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 90828 must be nullified for being not in accord with the law and the April 15, 2005 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 87931 must be upheld. Notwithstanding the nullification of the May 18, 2006 Decision of the Special Tenth Division in CA-G.R. SP No. 90828, the rendition of two conflicting decisions of the two CA Divisions over the same challenged resolutions of the MAB should be avoided  in the future as this is anathema to stability of judicial decisions and orderly administration of justice. The chronology of events reveals the following: January 10, 2005 – petitioner Celestial filed its petition docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 87931 with the CA. April 15, 2005 – the CA through its Twelfth  Division rendered its Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 87931 affirming the November 26, 2004 MAB Resolution. July 12, 2005 – respondent Blue Ridge filed its petition docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 90828 with the CA.  It is clear that the Blue Ridge petition was filed with the CA three  months after the decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 87931 was promulgated. May 18, 2006 – the CA through its Special Tenth Division rendered its Decision setting aside the November 26, 2004 and July 12, 2005 Resolutions of the MAB and reinstating the October 24, 2000 MAB Decision. From these facts, the CA Special Tenth Division should have ordered the consolidation of the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 90828 by CA-G.R. SP No. 87931 pursuant to the Internal Rules of the CA, the latter having the earlier docket number.  Had it done so, then the occurrence of the conflicting decisions could have been prevented.  The CA Special Tenth Division should have abided by our ruling in Nacuray v. NLRC , where we held, ""Consequently, a division cannot and should not review a case already passed upon by another Division of this Court.  It is only proper, to allow the case to take its rest after having attained finality."" [60] The CA should take the appropriate steps, including the adoption or amendment of the rules, to see to it that cases or petitions arising from the same questioned decision, order, or resolution are consolidated to steer clear of contrary or opposing decisions of the different CA Divisions and ensure that incidents of similar nature will not be replicated. G.R. No. 172936 No showing that the DENR Secretary gravely abused his discretion Now, going to the substance of the petition in G.R. No. 172936. A scrutiny of the records shows that the DENR Secretary did not gravely abuse his discretion in approving and signing MPSA Nos. 220-2005-IVB and 221-2005-IVB in favor of Macroasia. Petitioner Blue Ridge anchors its rights on the May 18, 2006 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 90828, which we have unfortunately struck down.  Blue Ridge's argument in assailing the approval and issuance of the subject MPSAs that it has been accorded preferential right by the CA has no leg to stand on. The October 24, 2000 MAB Decision, nullified by the subsequent November 26, 2004 Resolution, is unequivocal that Blue Ridge was granted only ""prior and preferential rights to FILE its mining application over the same mining claims."" [61] What was accorded Blue Ridge was only the right to file the mining application but with no assurance that the application will be recommended for approval by the MGB and finally approved by the DENR Secretary. Moreover, a preferential right would at most be an inchoate right to be given priority in the grant of a mining agreement. It has not yet been transformed into a legal and vested right unless approved by the MGB or DENR Secretary. Even if Blue Ridge has a preferential right over the subject mining claims, it is still within the competence and discretion of the DENR Secretary to grant mineral agreements to whomever he deems best to pursue the mining claims over and above the preferential status given to Blue Ridge. Besides, being simply a preferential right, it is ineffective to dissolve the pre-existing or subsisting mining lease contracts of Macroasia. The DENR Secretary has full discretion in the grant of mineral agreements Blue Ridge also argues that the Secretary gravely abused his discretion in approving the subject MPSAs without Macroasia complying with the mandatory requirements for mineral agreement applications under Sec. 35 of DENR AO 96-40. Petitioner specifically cited Sec. 36 of DENR AO 96-40 to the effect that ""no Mineral Agreement shall be approved unless the requirements under this section are fully complied with and any adverse claim/protest/opposition thereto is finally resolved by the Panel of Arbitrators.""  Moreover, Blue Ridge contends that the MPSAs were approved even prior to the issuance of the Compliance Certificate [62] by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples under the OP, which is a requisite pre-condition for the issuance of an MPSA. We are not persuaded. Blue Ridge cites Sec. 38 (not Sec. 36) of DENR AO 96-40 as basis for claiming that then DENR Secretary Defensor committed grave abuse of discretion in granting MPSA Nos. 220-2005-IVB and 221-2005-IVB to Macroasia.  Petitioner's postulation cannot be entertained for the reason that the issuance of the mining agreements was not raised before the MGB Director and DENR Secretary, nor was it amply presented before the CA. There is even a counter-charge that Blue Ridge has not complied with the legal requirements for a mining application. The rule is established that questions raised for the first time on appeal before this Court are not proper and have to be rejected.  Furthermore, the resolution of these factual issues would relegate the Court to a trier of facts.  The Blue Ridge plea is hindered by the factual issue bar rule where factual questions are proscribed under Rule 65. Lastly, there was no exhaustion of administrative remedies before the MGB and DENR.  Thus, Blue Ridge's petition must fail. Primary jurisdiction of the DENR Secretary in determining whether to grant or not a mineral agreement Verily, RA 7942, similar to PD 463, confers exclusive and primary jurisdiction on the DENR Secretary to approve mineral agreements, which is purely an administrative function within the scope of his powers and authority.  In exercising such exclusive primary jurisdiction, the DENR Secretary, through the MGB, has the best competence to determine to whom mineral agreements are granted.  Settled is the rule that the courts will defer to the decisions of the administrative offices and agencies by reason of their expertise and experience in the matters assigned to them pursuant to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. Administrative decisions on matter within the jurisdiction of administrative bodies are to be respected and can only be set aside on proof of grave abuse of discretion, fraud, or error of law. [63] Unless it is shown that the then DENR Secretary has acted in a wanton, whimsical, or oppressive manner, giving undue advantage to a party or for an illegal consideration and similar reasons, this Court cannot look into or review the wisdom of the exercise of such discretion. Blue Ridge failed in this regard. Delineation of powers and functions is accorded the three branches of government for the smooth functioning of the different governmental services.  We will not disturb nor interfere in the exercise of purely administrative functions of the executive branch absent a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion. Without a restraining order or injunction, litigation will not deter the DENR from exercising its functions While it is true that the subject mining claims are under litigation, this does not preclude the DENR and its Secretary from carrying out their functions and duties without a restraining order or an injunctive writ.  Otherwise, public interest and public service would unduly suffer by mere litigation of particular issues where government interests would be unduly affected.  In the instant case, it must be borne in mind that the government has a stake in the subject mining claims.  Also, Macroasia had various valid existing mining lease contracts over the subject mining lode claims issued by the DENR.  Thus, Macroasia has an advantage over Blue Ridge and Celestial insofar as the administrative aspect of pursuing the mineral agreements is concerned. WHEREFORE , the petitions under G.R. Nos. 169080, 172936, and 176229 are DISMISSED for lack of merit, while the petition under G.R. No. 176319 is hereby GRANTED .  The assailed April 15, 2005 Decision and August 3, 2005 Resolution of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 87931 are hereby AFFIRMED IN TOTO . And the May 18, 2006 Decision and January 19, 2007 Resolution of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 90828 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE .  In view of the foregoing considerations, we find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the then DENR Secretary in the approval and issuance of MPSA Nos. 220-2005-IVB and 221-2005-IVB.  Costs against Celestial Nickel Mining Exploration Corporation and Blue Ridge Mineral Corporation.

NO. 170470. September 26, 2006 ] PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. EDNA MALNGAN Y MAYO, APPELLANT. D E C I S I O N CHICO-NAZARIO, J.: The Case For review is the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals  in CA- G.R. CR HC No. 01139 promulgated on 2 September 2005, affirming with modification the Judgment [2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 41, in Criminal Case No. 01-188424 promulgated on 13 October 2003, finding appellant Edna Malngan y Mayo (Edna) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of ""Arson with Multiple Homicide or Arson resulting to the death of six (6) people,"" and sentencing her to suffer the penalty of death. The Facts As summarized [3] by the Court of Appeals,   the antecedent facts are as follows: From the personal account of Remigio Bernardo, the Barangay Chairman in the area, as well as the personal account of the pedicab driver named Rolando Gruta, it was at around 4:45 a.m. on January 2, 2001 when Remigio Bernardo and his tanods saw the accused-appellant EDNA, one hired as a housemaid by Roberto Separa, Sr., with her head turning in different directions, hurriedly leaving the house of her employer at No. 172 Moderna Street, Balut, Tondo, Manila. She was seen to have boarded a pedicab which was driven by a person later identified as Rolando Gruta. She was heard by the pedicab driver to have instructed that she be brought to Nipa Street, but upon her arrival there, she changed her mind and asked that she be brought instead to Balasan Street where she finally alighted, after paying for her fare. Thirty minutes later, at around 5:15 a.m. Barangay Chairman Bernardo's group later discovered that a fire gutted the house of the employer of the housemaid. Barangay Chairman Bernardo and his tanods responded to the fire upon hearing shouts from the residents and thereafter, firemen from the Fire District 1-NCR arrived at the fire scene to contain the fire. When Barangay Chairman Bernardo returned to the Barangay Hall, he received a report from pedicab driver Rolando Gruta, who was also a tanod, that shortly before the occurrence of the fire, he saw a woman (the housemaid) coming out of the house at No. 172 Moderna Street, Balut, Tondo, Manila and he received a call from his wife telling him of a woman (the same housemaid) who was acting strangely and suspiciously on Balasan Street. Barangay Chairman Bernardo, Rolando Gruta and the other tanods proceeded to Balasan Street and found the woman who was later identified as the accused-appellant. After Rolando Gruta positively identified the woman as the same person who left No. 172 Moderna Street, Balut, Tondo, Manila, Barangay Chairman Bernardo and his tanods apprehended her and brought her to the Barangay Hall for investigation. At the Barangay Hall, Mercedita Mendoza, neighbor of Roberto Separa, Sr. and whose house was also burned, identified the woman as accused-appellant EDNA who was the housemaid of Roberto Separa, Sr. Upon inspection, a disposable lighter was found inside accused- appellant EDNA's bag. Thereafter, accused-appellant EDNA confessed to Barangay Chairman Bernardo in the presence of multitudes of angry residents outside the Barangay Hall that she set her employer's house on fire because she had not been paid her salary for about a year and that she wanted to go home to her province but her employer told her to just ride a broomstick in going home. Accused-appellant EDNA was then turned over to arson investigators headed by S[F]O4  Danilo Talusan, who brought her to the San Lazaro Fire Station in Sta. Cruz, Manila where she was further investigated and then detained. When Mercedita Mendoza went to the San Lazaro Fire Station to give her sworn statement, she had the opportunity to ask accused-appellant EDNA at the latter's detention cell why she did the burning of her employer's house and accused-appellant EDNA replied that she set the house on fire because when she asked permission to go home to her province, the wife of her employer Roberto Separa, Sr., named Virginia Separa (sic) shouted at her: ""Sige umuwi ka, pagdating mo maputi ka na. Sumakay ka sa walis, pagdating mo maputi ka na"" (TSN, January 22, 2002, p.6) (""Go ahead, when you arrive your color would be fair already. Ride a broomstick, when you arrive your color would be fair already."") And when Mercedita Mendoza asked accused-appellant EDNA how she burned the house, accused-appellant EDNA told her: ""Naglukot ako ng maraming diyaryo, sinindihan ko ng disposable lighter at hinagis ko sa ibabaw ng lamesa sa loob ng bahay"" (TSN, January 22, 2002, p. 7.) (""I crumpled newspapers, lighted them with a disposable lighter and threw them on top of the table inside the house."") When interviewed by Carmelita Valdez, a reporter of ABS-CBN Network, accused-appellant EDNA while under detention (sic) was heard by SFO4 (sic) Danilo Talusan as having admitted the crime and even narrated the manner how she accomplished it. SFO4 (sic) Danilo Talusan was able to hear the same confession, this time at his home, while watching the television program ""True Crime"" hosted by Gus Abelgas also of ABS-CBN Network. The fire resulted in [the] destruction of the house of Roberto Separa, Sr. and other adjoining houses and the death of Roberto Separa, Sr. and Virginia Separa together with their four (4) children, namely: Michael, Daphne, Priscilla and Roberto, Jr. On 9 January 2001, an Information [4] was filed before the RTC of Manila, Branch 41, charging accused-appellant with the crime of Arson with Multiple Homicide. The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 01-188424. The accusatory portion of said Information provides: That on or about January 2, 2001, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, with intent to cause damage, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and deliberately set fire upon the two-storey residential house of ROBERTO SEPARA and family mostly made of wooden materials located at No. 172 Moderna St., Balut, Tondo, this city, by lighting crumpled newspaper with the use of disposable lighter inside said house knowing the same to be an inhabited house and situated in a thickly populated place and as a consequence thereof a conflagration ensued and the said building, together with some seven (7) adjoining residential houses, were razed by fire; that by reason and on the occasion of the said fire, the following, namely, Roberto Separa, Sr., 45 years of age Virginia Separa y Mendoza, 40 years of age Michael Separa, 24 years of age Daphne Separa, 18 years of age Priscilla Separa, 14 years of age Roberto Separa, Jr., 11 years of age sustained burn injuries which were the direct cause of their death immediately thereafter. [5] When arraigned, accused-appellant with assistance of counsel de oficio , pleaded [6] ""Not Guilty"" to the crime charged. Thereafter, trial ensued. [7] The prosecution presented five (5) witnesses, namely, SPO4 [8] Danilo Talusan, Rolando Gruta, Remigio Bernardo, Mercedita Mendoza and Rodolfo Movilla to establish its charge that accused-appellant Edna committed the crime of arson with multiple homicide. SPO4 Danilo Talusan, arson investigator, testified that he was one of those who responded to the fire that occurred on 2 January 2001 and which started at No. 172 Moderna St., Balut, Tondo, Manila.  He stated that the fire killed Roberto Separa, Sr. and all the other members of his family, namely his wife, Virginia, and his children, Michael, Daphne, Priscilla and Roberto, Jr.; the fire also destroyed their abode as well as six neighboring houses.  He likewise testified that he twice heard accused- appellant - once while the latter was being interviewed by Carmelita Valdez, a reporter of ABS-CBN, and the other time when it was shown on channel 2 on television during the airing of the television program entitled ""True Crime"" hosted by Gus Abelgas - confess to having committed the crime charged, to wit: Pros. Rebagay: Based on your investigation, was there any occasion when the accused Edna Malngan admitted to the burning of the house of the Separa Family? x x x x Witness: Yes, sir. Pros. Rebagay: When was that? A: On January 2 she was interviewed by the media, sir. The one who took the coverage was Carmelita Valdez of Channel 2, ABS-CBN. They have a footage that Edna admitted before them, sir. Q: And where were you when Edna Malngan made that statement or admission to Carmelita Valdez of ABS-CBN? A: I was at our office, sir.

[11] For her part, Mercedita Mendoza, one of the neighbors of the Separa Family and whose house was one of those destroyed by the fire, recounted: Pros.

(sic) [12] Lastly, the prosecution presented Rodolfo Movilla, owner of the house situated beside that of the Separa family. He testified that his house was also gutted by the fire that killed the Separa family and that he tried to help said victims but to no avail. The prosecution presented other documentary evidence [13] and thereafter rested its case. When it came time for the defense to present exculpatory evidence, instead of doing so, accused- appellant filed a Motion to Admit Demurrer to Evidence [14] and the corresponding Demurrer to Evidence [15] with the former expressly stating that said Demurrer to Evidence was being filed ""x x x without express leave of court x x x."" [16] In her Demurrer to Evidence , accused-appellant asserts that the prosecution's evidence was insufficient to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the following reasons: [17] (a) that she is charged with crime not defined and penalized by law; (b) that circumstantial evidence was insufficient to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt; and (c) that the testimonies given by the witnesses of the prosecution were hearsay, thus, inadmissible in evidence against her. The prosecution filed its Comment/Opposition to accused-appellant's Demurrer to Evidence. On 13 October 2003, acting on the Demurrer to Evidence, the RTC promulgated its Judgment [18] wherein it proceeded to resolve the subject case based on the evidence of the prosecution. The RTC considered accused-appellant to have waived her right to present evidence, having filed the Demurrer to Evidence without leave of court. In finding accused-appellant Edna guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Arson with Multiple Homicide, the RTC ruled that: The first argument of the accused that she is charged with an act not defined and penalized by law is without merit. x x x the caption which charges the accused with the crime of Arson with Multiple Homicide is merely descriptive of the charge of Arson that resulted to Multiple Homicide. The fact is that the accused is charged with Arson which resulted to Multiple Homicide (death of victims) and that charge is embodied and stated in the body of the information. What is controlling is the allegation in the body of the Information and not the title or caption thereof. x x x. x x x x The second and third arguments will be discussed jointly as they are interrelated with each other. x x x. x x x x [W]hile there is no direct evidence that points to the accused in the act of burning the house or actually starting the subject fire, the following circumstances that show that the accused intentionally caused or was responsible for the subject fire have been duly established: that immediately before the burning of the house, the accused hurriedly and with head turning in different directions (palinga-linga) went out of the said house and rode a pedicab apparently not knowing where to go x x x; that immediately after the fire, upon a report that there was a woman in Balasan St. who appears confused and apprehensive (balisa), the Barangay Chairman and his tanods went there, found the accused and apprehended her and brought her to the barangay hall as shown by the testimony of Barangay Chairman Remigio Bernardo; and that when she was apprehended and investigated by the barangay officials and when her bag was opened, the same contained a disposable lighter as likewise shown by the testimony of the Barangay Chairman. [T]he timing of her hurried departure and nervous demeanor immediately before the fire when she left the house and rode a pedicab and her same demeanor, physical and mental condition when found and apprehended at the same place where she alighted from the pedicab and the discovery of the lighter in her bag thereafter when investigated indisputably show her guilt as charged. If there is any doubt of her guilt that remains with the circumstantial evidence against her, the same is removed or obliterated with the confessions/admissions of the commission of the offense and the manner thereof that she made to the prosecution witnesses Barangay Chairman Remigio Bernardo, Mercedita Mendoza and to the media, respectively. x x x x [H]er confessions/admissions are positive acknowledgment of guilt of the crime and appear to have been voluntarily and intelligently given. These confessions/admissions, especially the one given to her neighbor Mercedita Mendoza and the media, albeit uncounselled and made while she was already under the custody of authorities, it is believed, are not violative of her right under the Constitution. The decretal part of the RTC's Judgment reads: WHEREFORE, the Demurrer to Evidence is hereby denied and judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused EDNA MALNGAN Y MAYO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Arson with Multiple Homicide or Arson resulting to the death of six (6) people and sentencing her to suffer the mandatory penalty of death, and ordering her to pay the heirs of the victims Roberto Separa, Sr. and Virginia Separa and children Michael, Daphne, Priscilla and Roberto, Jr., the amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos for each victim and the amount of One Hundred Thousand (P100,000.00) Pesos as temperate damages for their burned house or a total of Four Hundred Thousand (P400,000.00) Pesos and to Rodolfo Movilla the amount of One Hundred [Thousand] (P100,000.00) Pesos. Due to the death penalty imposed by the RTC, the case was directly elevated to this Court for automatic review. Conformably with our decision in People v. Efren Mateo y Garcia, [19] however, we referred the case and its records to the CA for appropriate action and disposition. On 2 September 2005, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification the decision of the RTC, the fallo of which reads: WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed October 13, 2003 Judgment of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 41, finding accused-appellant Edna Malngan y Mayo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Arson with multiple homicide and sentencing her to suffer the DEATH PENALTY is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that she is further ordered to pay P50,000.00 as moral damages and another P50,000.00 as exemplary damages for each of the victims who perished in the fire, to be paid to their heirs. She is ordered to pay Rodolfo Movilla, one whose house was also burned, the sum of P50,000.00 as exemplary damage. Pursuant to Section 13 (a), Rule 124 of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure as amended by A.M. No. 00-5-03-SC dated September 28, 2004, which became effective on October 15, 2004, the Court of Appeals, after rendering judgment, hereby refrains from making an entry of judgment and forthwith certifies the case and elevates the entire record of this case to the Supreme Court for review. [20] It is the contention of accused-appellant that the evidence presented by the prosecution is not sufficient to establish her guilt beyond reasonable doubt as the perpetrator of the crime charged. In support of said exculpatory proposition, she assigns the following errors [21] : I. THE HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE PROSECUTION IS SUFFICIENT TO CONVICT THE ACCUSED; and II. THE HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN ALLOWING AND GIVING CREDENCE TO THE HEARSAY EVIDENCE AND UNCOUNSELLED ADMISSIONS ALLEGEDLY GIVEN BY THE ACCUSED TO THE WITNESSES BARANGAY CHAIRMAN REMIGIO BERNARDO, MERCEDITA MENDOZA AND THE MEDIA. THERE IS NO COMPLEX CRIME OF ARSON WITH (MULTIPLE) HOMECIDE . The Information in this case erroneously charged accused-appellant with a complex crime, i.e., Arson with Multiple Homicide . Presently, there are two (2) laws that govern the crime of arson where death results therefrom- Article 320 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 7659, [22] and Section 5 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1613 [23] , quoted hereunder, to wit: Revised Penal Code: ART. 320. Destructive Arson. - x x x x If as a consequence of the commission of any of the acts penalized under this Article, death results , the mandatory penalty of death shall be imposed . [Emphasis supplied.] Presidential Decree No. 1613: SEC. 5. Where Death Results from Arson. - If by reason of or on the occasion of the arson death results , the penalty of reclusion perpetua to death shall be imposed . [Emphasis supplied.] Art. 320 of the RPC, as amended , with respect to destructive arson, and the provisions of PD No. 1613 respecting other cases of arson provide only one penalty for the commission of arson, whether considered destructive or otherwise, where death results therefrom . The raison d'être is that arson is itself the end and death is simply the consequence. [24] Whether the crime of arson will absorb the resultant death or will have to be a separate crime altogether, the joint discussion [25] of the late Mr. Chief Justice Ramon C. Aquino and Mme. Justice Carolina C. Griño-Aquino, on the subject of the crimes of arson and murder/homicide, is highly instructive: Groizard says that when fire is used with the intent to kill a particular person who may be in a house and that objective is attained by burning the house, the crime is murder only. When the Penal Code declares that killing committed by means of fire is murder, it intends that fire should be purposely adopted as a means to that end. There can be no murder without a design to take life. [26] In other words, if the main object of the offender is to kill by means of fire, the offense is murder. But if the main objective is the burning of the building, the resulting homicide may be absorbed by the crime of arson. [27] x x x x If the house was set on fire after the victims therein were killed, fire would not be a qualifying circumstance. The accused would be liable for the separate offenses of murder or homicide, as the case may be, and arson. [28] Accordingly, in cases where both burning and death occur, in order to determine what crime/crimes was/were perpetrated - whether arson, murder or arson and homicide/murder, it is de rigueur to ascertain the main objective of the malefactor: (a) if the main objective is the burning of the building or edifice, but death results by reason or on the occasion of arson, the crime is simply arson , and the resulting homicide is absorbed; (b) if, on the other hand, the main objective is to kill a particular person who may be in a building or edifice, when fire is resorted to as the means to accomplish such goal the crime committed is murder only; lastly, (c) if the objective is, likewise, to kill a particular person, and in fact the offender has already done so, but fire is resorted to as a means to cover up the killing, then there are two separate and distinct crimes committed - homicide/murder and arson . Where then does this case fall under? From a reading of the body of the Information: That on or about January 2, 2001, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, with intent to cause damage , did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and deliberately set fire upon the two-storey residential house of ROBERTO SEPARA and family mostly made of wooden materials located at No. 172 Moderna St., Balut, Tondo, this city, by lighting crumpled newspaper with the use of disposable lighter inside said house knowing the same to be an inhabited house and situated in a thickly populated place and as a consequence thereof a conflagration ensued and the said building, together with some seven (7) adjoining residential houses, were razed by fire; that by reason and on the occasion of the said fire , the following, namely, Roberto Separa, Sr., 45 years of age Virginia Separa y Mendoza, 40 years of age Michael Separa, 24 years of age Daphne Separa, 18 years of age Priscilla Separa, 14 years of age Roberto Separa, Jr., 11 years of age sustained burn injuries which were the direct cause of their death immediately thereafter. [29] [Emphasis supplied.] accused-appellant is being charged with the crime of arson. It it is clear from the foregoing that her intent was merely to destroy her employer's house through the use of fire. We now go to the issues raised. Under the first assignment of error, in asserting the insufficiency of the prosecution's evidence to establish her guilt beyond reasonable doubt, accused-appellant argues that the prosecution was only able to adduce circumstantial evidence - hardly enough to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt. She ratiocinates that the following circumstances: That immediately before the burning of the house , the accused hurriedly and with head turning in different directions (palinga-linga) went out of the said house and rode a pedicab apparently not knowing where to go for she first requested to be brought to Nipa St. but upon reaching there requested again to be brought to Balasan St. as shown by the testimony of prosecution witness Rolando Gruta; That immediately after the fire, upon a report that there was a woman in Balasan St. who appears confused and apprehensive ( balisa ), the Barangay Chairman and his tanods went there, found the accused and apprehended her and brought her to the barangay hall as shown by the testimony of Barangay Chairman Remigio Bernardo; and That when she was apprehended and investigated by the barangay officials and when her bag was opened, the same contained a disposable lighter as likewise shown by the testimony of the Barangay Chairman. [30] fall short of proving that she had any involvement in setting her employer's house on fire, much less show guilt beyond reasonable doubt, given that ""it is a fact that housemaids are the first persons in the house to wake up early to perform routine chores for their employers,"" [31] one of which is preparing and cooking the morning meal for the members of the household; and necessity requires her to go out early to look for open stores or even nearby marketplaces to buy things that will complete the early meal for the day. [32] She then concludes that it was normal for her to have been seen going out of her employer's house in a hurry at that time of the day and ""to look at all directions to insure that the house is secure and that there are no other persons in the vicinity."" [33] We are far from persuaded. True, by the nature of their jobs, housemaids are required to start the day early; however, contrary to said assertion, the actuations and the demeanor of accused-appellant on that fateful early morning as observed firsthand by Rolando Gruta, one of the witnesses of the prosecution, belie her claim of normalcy, to wit: Q: You said you saw Edna coming out from the house of the Separa Family. What happened when you saw Edna coming out from the house of the Separa Family? A: ""Wala pa pong ano 'yan naisakay ko na siya sa sidecar."" Q: And what did you observe from Edna when you saw her coming out from the house of the Separa family? A: "" Nagmamadali po siyang lumakad at palinga-linga ."" x x x x Q: After she boarded your pedicab, what happened, if any? A: ""Nagpahatid po siya sa akin."" Q: Where? A: To Nipa Street, sir. Q: Did you bring her to Nipa Street as she requested? A: Yes, sir. x x x x Q: You said that you brought her to Nipa Street. What happened when you go (sic) there at Nipa Street, if any? A: ""Nagpahinto po siya doon ng saglit, mga tatlong minuto po."" Q: What did she do when she asked (you) to stop there for three minutes? A: After three minutes she requested me to bring her directly to Balasan Street, sir. x x x x We quote with approval the pronouncement of the RTC in discrediting accused-appellant's aforementioned rationale: [O]bviously it is never normal, common or ordinary to leave the house in such a disturbed, nervous and agitated manner, demeanor and condition. The timing of her hurried departure and nervous demeanor immediately before the fire when she left the house and rode a pedicab and her same demeanor, physical and mental condition when found and apprehended at the same place where she alighted from the pedicab and the discovery of the lighter in her bag thereafter when investigated indisputably show her guilt as charged. [34] All the witnesses are in accord that accused-appellant's agitated appearance was out of the ordinary. Remarkably, she has never denied this observation. We give great weight to the findings of the RTC and so accord credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as it had the opportunity to observe them directly.  The credibility given by trial courts to prosecution witnesses is an important aspect of evidence which appellate courts can rely on because of its unique opportunity to observe them, particularly their demeanor, conduct, and attitude, during the direct and cross-examination by counsels.  Here, Remigio Bernardo, Rolando Gruta and Mercedita Mendoza are disinterested witnesses and there is not an iota of evidence in the records to indicate that they are suborned witnesses.  The records of the RTC even show that Remigio Bernardo, the Barangay Chairman, kept accused-appellant from being mauled by the angry crowd outside of the barangay hall: Pros. Rebagay: Now, who were present when the accused are (sic) telling you this? A: ""Iyon nga iyong mga tanod ko, mamamayan doon nakapaligid, siyempre may sunog nagkakagulo, gusto nga siyang kunin ng mga mamamayan para saktan hindi ko maibigay papatayin siya gawa ng may namatay eh anim na tao and namatay, kaya iyong mga tao kinokontrol siya madidisgrasya siya dahil pin-pointed po siya, Your Honor, iyong dami na iyon libo iyong nakapaligid doon sa barangay hall napakahirap awatin. Gusting-gusto siyang kunin ng mga taong-bayan, nagalit dahil ang daming bahay hong nasunog."" [35] Accused-appellant has not shown any compelling reason why the witnesses presented would openly, publicly and deliberately lie or concoct a story, to send an innocent person to jail all the while knowing that the real malefactor remains at large.  Such proposition defies logic.  And where the defense failed to show any evil or improper motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses, the presumption is that their testimonies are true and thus entitled to full faith and credence. [36] While the prosecution witnesses did not see accused-appellant actually starting the fire that burned several houses and killed the Separa family, her guilt may still be established through circumstantial evidence provided that: (1) there is more than one circumstance; (2) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and, (3) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce conviction beyond reasonable doubt. [37] Circumstantial evidence is that evidence which proves a fact or series of facts from which the facts in issue may be established by inference. [38] It is founded on experience and observed facts and coincidences establishing a connection between the known and proven facts and the facts sought to be proved. [39] In order to bring about a conviction, the circumstantial evidence presented must constitute an unbroken chain, which leads to one fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of others, as the guilty person. [40] In this case, the interlocking testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, taken together, exemplify a case where conviction can be upheld on the basis of circumstantial evidence.  First, prosecution witness Rolando Gruta, the driver of the pedicab that accused-appellant rode on, testified that he knew for a fact that she worked as a housemaid of the victims, and that he positively identified her as the person hurriedly leaving the house of the victims on 2 January 2001 at 4:45 a.m., and acting in a nervous manner.  That while riding on the pedicab, accused-appellant was unsure of her intended destination. Upon reaching the place where he originally picked up accused-appellant only a few minutes after dropping her off, Rolando Gruta saw the Separas' house being gutted by a blazing fire.  Second, Remigio Bernardo testified that he and his tanods , including Rolando Gruta, were the ones who picked up accused-appellant Edna at Balasan Street (where Rolando Gruta dropped her off) after receiving a call that there was a woman acting strangely at said street and who appeared to have nowhere to go.  Third, SPO4 Danilo Talusan overheard accused-appellant admit to Carmelita Valdez, a reporter of Channel 2 (ABS-CBN) that said accused-appellant started the fire, plus the fact that he was able see the telecast of Gus Abelgas' show where accused-appellant, while being interviewed, confessed to the crime as well. The foregoing testimonies juxtaposed with the testimony of Mercedita Mendoza validating the fact that accused-appellant confessed to having started the fire which killed the Separa family as well as burned seven houses including that of the victims, convincingly form an unbroken chain, which leads to the unassailable conclusion pinpointing accused-appellant as the person behind the crime of simple arson. In her second assigned error, accused-appellant questions the admissibility of her uncounselled extrajudicial confession given to prosecution witnesses, namely Remigio Bernardo, Mercedita Mendoza, and to the media. Accused-appellant Edna contends that being uncounselled extrajudicial confession, her admissions to having committed the crime charged should have been excluded in evidence against her for being violative of Article III, Section 12(1) of the Constitution. Particularly, she takes exception to the testimony of prosecution witnesses Remigio Bernardo and Mercedita Mendoza for being hearsay and in the nature of an uncounselled admission. With the above vital pieces of evidence excluded, accused-appellant is of the position that the remaining proof of her alleged guilt, consisting in the main of circumstantial evidence, is inadequate to establish her guilt beyond reasonable doubt. We partly disagree. Article III, Section 12 of the Constitution in part provides: (1)     Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice. If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one.  These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel. x x x x (3)     Any confession or admission obtained in violation of this Section or Section 17 hereof shall be inadmissible in evidence. We have held that the abovequoted provision applies to the stage of custodial investigation - when the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but starts to focus on a particular person as a suspect. [41] Said constitutional guarantee has also been extended to situations in which an individual has not been formally arrested but has merely been ""invited"" for questioning. [42] To be admissible in evidence against an accused, the extrajudicial confessions made must satisfy the following requirements: (1) it must be voluntary; (2) it must be made with the assistance of competent and independent counsel; (3) it must be express; and (4)     it must be in writing. [43] Arguably , the barangay tanods, including the Barangay Chairman, in this particular instance, may be deemed as law enforcement officer for purposes of applying Article III, Section 12(1) and (3), of the Constitution. When accused-appellant was brought to the barangay hall in the morning of 2 January 2001, she was already a suspect, actually the only one, in the fire that destroyed several houses as well as killed the whole family of Roberto Separa, Sr.  She was, therefore, already under custodial investigation and the rights guaranteed by Article III, Section 12(1), of the Constitution should have already been observed or applied to her. Accused-appellant's confession to Barangay Chairman Remigio Bernardo was made in response to the ""interrogation"" made by the latter - admittedly conducted without first informing accused-appellant of her rights under the Constitution or done in the presence of counsel.  For this reason, the confession of accused-appellant, given to Barangay Chairman Remigio Bernardo, as well as the lighter found by the latter in her bag are inadmissible in evidence against her as such were obtained in violation of her constitutional rights. Be that as it may, the inadmissibility of accused-appellant's confession to Barangay Chairman Remigio Bernardo and the lighter as evidence do not automatically lead to her acquittal.  It should well be recalled that the constitutional safeguards during custodial investigations do not apply to those not elicited through questioning by the police or their agents but given in an ordinary manner whereby the accused verbally admits to having committed the offense as what happened in the case at bar when accused-appellant admitted to Mercedita Mendoza, one of the neighbors of Roberto Separa, Sr., to having started the fire in the Separas' house.  The testimony of Mercedita Mendoza recounting said admission is, unfortunately for accused-appellant, admissible in evidence against her and is not covered by the aforesaid constitutional guarantee. Article III of the Constitution, or the Bill of Rights, solely governs the relationship between the individual on one hand and the State (and its agents) on the other; it does not concern itself with the relation between a private individual and another private individual - as both accused-appellant and prosecution witness Mercedita Mendoza undoubtedly are. [44] Here, there is no evidence on record to show that said witness was acting under police authority, so appropriately, accused-appellant's uncounselled extrajudicial confession to said witness was properly admitted by the RTC. Accused-appellant likewise assails the admission of the testimony of SPO4 Danilo Talusan.  Contending that ""[w]hen SPO4 Danilo Talusan testified in court, his story is more of events, which are not within his personal knowledge but based from accounts of witnesses who derived information allegedly from the accused or some other persons x x x"".  In other words, she objects to the testimony for being merely hearsay.  With this imputation of inadmissibility, we agree with what the Court of Appeals had to say: Although this testimony of SFO4 Danilo Talusan is hearsay because he was not present when Gus Abelgas interviewed accused-appellant EDNA, it may nevertheless be admitted in evidence as an independently relevant statement to establish not the truth but the tenor of the statement or the fact that the statement was made [People v. Mallari, G.R. No. 103547, July 20, 1999, 310 SCRA 621 citing People v. Cusi, Jr., G.R. No. L-20986, August 14, 1965, 14 SCRA 944.]. In People vs. Velasquez, G.R. Nos. 132635 & 143872-75, February 21, 2001, 352 SCRA 455 , the Supreme Court ruled that: ""Under the doctrine of independently relevant statements, regardless of their truth or falsity, the fact that such statements have been made is relevant. The hearsay rule does not apply, and the statements are admissible as evidence. Evidence as to the making of such statement is not secondary but primary, for the statement itself may constitute a fact in issue or be circumstantially relevant as to the existence of such a fact."" [45] As regards the confession given by accused-appellant to the media, we need not discuss it further for the reporters were never presented to testify in court. As a final attempt at exculpation, accused-appellant asserts that since the identities of the burned bodies were never conclusively established, she cannot be responsible for their deaths. Such assertion is bereft of merit. In the crime of arson, the identities of the victims are immaterial in that intent to kill them particularly is not one of the elements of the crime. As we have clarified earlier, the killing of a person is absorbed in the charge of arson, simple or destructive.  The prosecution need only prove, that the burning was intentional and that what was intentionally burned is an inhabited house or dwelling.  Again, in the case of People v. Soriano , [46] we explained that: Although intent may be an ingredient of the crime of Arson, it may be inferred from the acts of the accused. There is a presumption that one intends the natural consequences of his act; and when it is shown that one has deliberately set fire to a building, the prosecution is not bound to produce further evidence of his wrongful intent. [47] The ultimate query now is which kind of arson is accused-appellant guilty of? As previously discussed, there are two (2) categories of the crime of arson: 1) destructive arson , under Art. 320 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659; and 2) simple arson , under Presidential Decree No. 1613.  Said classification is based on the kind, character and location of the property burned, regardless of the value of the damage caused, [48] to wit: Article 320 of The Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659, contemplates the malicious burning of structures, both public and private, hotels, buildings, edifices, trains, vessels, aircraft, factories and other military, government or commercial establishments by any person or group of persons .[ [49] ]  The classification of this type of crime is known as Destructive Arson, which is punishable by reclusion perpetua to death. The reason for the law is self- evident: to effectively discourage and deter the commission of this dastardly crime, to prevent the destruction of properties and protect the lives of innocent people. Exposure to a brewing conflagration leaves only destruction and despair in its wake; hence, the State mandates greater retribution to authors of this heinous crime . The exceptionally severe punishment imposed for this crime takes into consideration the extreme danger to human lives exposed by the malicious burning of these structures; the danger to property resulting from the conflagration; the fact that it is normally difficult to adopt precautions against its commission, and the difficulty in pinpointing the perpetrators; and, the greater impact on the social, economic, security and political fabric of the nation. [Emphasis supplied.] If as a consequence of the commission of any of the acts penalized under Art. 320, death should result, the mandatory penalty of death shall be imposed. On the other hand, PD 1613 which repealed Arts. 321 to 326-B of The Revised Penal Code remains the governing law for Simple Arson. This decree contemplates the malicious burning of public and private structures, regardless of size, not included in Art. 320, as amended by RA 7659, and classified as other cases of arson. These include houses, dwellings, government buildings, farms, mills, plantations, railways, bus stations, airports, wharves and other industrial establishments .[ [50] ] Although the purpose of the law on Simple Arson is to prevent the high incidence of fires and other crimes involving destruction, protect the national economy and preserve the social, economic and political stability of the nation, PD 1613 tempers the penalty to be meted to offenders. This separate classification of Simple Arson recognizes the need to lessen the severity of punishment commensurate to the act or acts committed, depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each case. [Emphasis supplied.] To emphasize: The nature of Destructive Arson is distinguished from Simple Arson by the degree of perversity or viciousness of the criminal offender. The acts committed under Art. 320 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended) constituting Destructive Arson are characterized as heinous crimes for being grievous, odious and hateful offenses and which, by reason of their inherent or manifest wickedness, viciousness, atrocity and perversity are repugnant and outrageous to the common standards and norms of decency and morality in a just, civilized and ordered society. [51] On the other hand, acts committed under PD 1613 constituting Simple Arson are crimes with a lesser degree of perversity and viciousness that the law punishes with a lesser penalty. In other words, Simple Arson contemplates crimes with less significant social, economic, political and national security implications than Destructive Arson. However, acts falling under Simple Arson may nevertheless be converted into Destructive Arson depending on the qualifying circumstances present. [Emphasis supplied.] [52] Prescinding from the above clarification vis-à-vis the description of the crime as stated in the accusatory portion of the Information, it is quite evident that accused-appellant was charged with the crime of Simple Arson - for having ""deliberately set fire upon the two-storey residential house of ROBERTO SEPARA and family x x x knowing the same to be an inhabited house and situated in a thickly populated place and as a consequence thereof a conflagration ensued and the said building, together with some seven (7) adjoining residential houses, were razed by fire."" [Emphasis supplied.] The facts of the case at bar is somewhat similar to the facts of the case of People v. Soriano . [53] The accused in the latter case caused the burning of a particular house.  Unfortunately, the blaze spread and gutted down five (5) neighboring houses.  The RTC therein found the accused guilty of destructive arson under paragraph 1 [54] of Art. 320 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659.  This Court, through Mr. Justice Bellosillo, however, declared that: x x x [T]he applicable provision of law should be Sec. 3, par. 2, of PD 1613, which imposes a penalty of reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua  for other cases of arson as the properties burned by accused-appellant are specifically described as houses, contemplating inhabited houses or dwellings under the aforesaid law. The descriptions as alleged in the second Amended Information particularly refer to the structures as houses rather than as buildings or edifices. The applicable law should therefore be Sec. 3, Par. 2, of PD 1613, and not Art. 320, par. 1 of the Penal Code. In case of ambiguity in construction of penal laws, it is well-settled that such laws shall be construed strictly against the government, and liberally in favor of the accused. The elements of arson under Sec. 3, par. 2, of PD 1613 are: (a) there is intentional burning; and (b) what is intentionally burned is an inhabited house or dwelling. Incidentally, these elements concur in the case at bar. [55] As stated in the body of the Information, accused-appellant was charged with having intentionally burned the two-storey residential house of Robert Separa.  Said conflagration likewise spread and destroyed seven (7) adjoining houses . Consequently, if proved, as it was proved, at the trial, she may be convicted, and sentenced accordingly, of the crime of simple arson .  Such is the case ""notwithstanding the error in the designation of the offense in the information, the information remains effective insofar as it states the facts constituting the crime alleged therein."" [56] ""What is controlling is not the title of the complaint, nor the designation of the offense charged or the particular law or part thereof allegedly violate, x x x, but the description of the crime charged and the particular facts therein recited."" [57] There is, thus, a need to modify the penalty imposed by the RTC as Sec. 5 of PD No. 1613 categorically provides that the penalty to be imposed for simple arson is: SEC. 5. Where Death Results from Arson . -  If by reason of or on the occasion of arson death results, the penalty of reclusion perpetua to death shall be imposed. [Emphasis supplied.] Accordingly, there being no aggravating circumstance alleged in the Information, the imposable penalty on accused-appellant is reclusion perpetua . Apropos the civil liabilities of accused-appellant, current jurisprudence [58] dictate that the civil indemnity due from accused-appellant is P50,000.00 for the death of each of the victims. [59] However, the monetary awards for moral and exemplary damages given by the Court of Appeals, both in the amount of P50,000.00, due the heirs of the victims, have to be deleted for lack of material basis. Similarly, the Court of Appeals award of exemplary damages to Rodolfo Movilla in the amount of P50,000.00 for the destruction of his house, also has to be deleted , but in this instance for being improper.  Moral damages cannot be award by this Court in the absence of proof of mental or physical suffering on the part of the heirs of the victims. [60] Concerning the award of exemplary damages, the reason for the deletion being that no aggravating circumstance had been alleged and proved by the prosecution in the case at bar. [61] To summarize, accused-appellant's alternative plea that she be acquitted of the crime must be rejected. With the evidence on record, we find no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the RTC and the Court of Appeals.  It is indubitable that accused-appellant is the author of the crime of simple arson.  All the circumstantial evidence presented before the RTC, viewed in its entirety, is as convincing as direct evidence and, as such, negates accused-appellant's innocence, and when considered concurrently with her admission given to Mercedita Mendoza, the former's guilt beyond reasonable doubt is twice as evident.  Hence, her conviction is effectively justified.  More so, as it is propitious to note that in stark contrast to the factual circumstances presented by the prosecution, accused-appellant neither mustered a denial nor an alibi except for the proposition that her guilt had not been established beyond reasonable doubt. IN VIEW WHEREOF, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 2 September 2005, in CA G.R. CR HC No. 01139, is hereby AFFIRMED insofar as the conviction of accused-appellant EDNA MALNGAN Y MAYO is concerned. The sentence to be imposed and the amount of damages to be awarded, however, are MODIFIED. In accordance with Sec. 5 of Presidential Decree No. 1613, accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to RECLUSION PERPETUA . Accused-appellant is hereby ordered to pay the heirs of each of the victims P50,000.00 as civil indemnity. SO ORDERED. Panganiban, C.

NO. MTJ-06-1641 (Formerly A.M. OCA IPI No. 05-1756-MTJ). July 27, 2006 ] NOTAN LUMBOS, COMPLAINANT, VS. JUDGE MARIE ELLENGRID S.L. BALIGUAT, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT IN CITIES, BRANCH 1, GENERAL SANTOS CITY RESPONDENT. R E S O L U T I O N AUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J. Before us is an administrative complaint [1] dated July 28, 2005 filed by Notan Lumbos (complainant) against Judge Marie Ellengrid S.L. Baliguat (respondent), Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Branch 1, General Santos City, for Gross Ignorance of the Law, Grave Abuse of Authority, Dereliction of Duty, Grave Misconduct, Oppression and Disbarment (under Resolution A.M. No. 02-9-02-SC, October 1, 2002). Complainant alleges that: he is one of the accused in a complaint for arson and robbery in Criminal Cases Nos. 46246 and 46247 filed by P/Insp. Richie Siong Bucol on July 14, 2004 before respondent's sala; instead of dismissing the case for patent lack of jurisdiction, respondent propounded a series of leading questions on the witnesses i.e., Jose Orlando Acharon (Acharon) and Edwin Yagat (Yagat) even without prior application for the issuance of warrant of arrest; with the object of issuing a warrant of arrest against all accused, respondent propounded a series of suggestive rather than searching questions on Acharon, who did not actually witness the alleged crime; the purported eye witness Yagat never categorically named the alleged malefactors and their specific participation in the alleged crimes; respondent merely tried to confirm her preconceived presumption of guilt of all accused via suggestive questions; respondent issued an Order for the issuance of a warrant of arrest against complainant and his co-accused without giving them a fair chance to file their respective counter-affidavits; he with his co-accused, filed two motions dated July 24, 2004 and August 17, 2004, respectively, for purposes of lifting the warrant of arrest and proper referral of subject cases to the Office of the City Prosecutor so they can file their respective counter-affidavits; attached to the motion is an excerpt from the police blotter certifying that on July 11, 2004 at 8:30 in the evening, complainant was in Philippine National Police-Camp Lira, which is approximately 25 kilometers from Bawing, Tambler where the alleged crimes were committed; his presence in Camp Lira was precipitated by the suspicious apprehension of some relatives who were detained in the said camp; on September 1, 2004, the Provincial Office of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples intervened through a Manifestation dated August 30, 2004, praying for the dismissal of the subject cases stating that Acharon, the complainant in the said cases, has no real right or interest to protect, none of his rights were violated, he (Acharon) is even vulnerable to criminal prosecution under Republic Act No. 947, and, the filing of the subject cases in an effort to restrain the legitimate claimants appears to be a mockery of the judicial process; respondent issued an Order dated October 26, 2004 holding in abeyance the prayer for the lifting of the warrant of arrest, pending the submission of counter-affidavits within 10 days from receipt of the Order. In her Comment [2] dated September 9, 2005, respondent avers that: the criminal cases subject of this complaint were filed before the MTCC, General Santos City, for Preliminary Investigation (PI); on July 15, 2004, being the Executive Judge and by virtue of Sections 84 and 86, Republic Act No. 5412, [3] otherwise known as the City Charter of General Santos City, Acharon (the complainant in the said cases) and Yagat (the eye witness to the alleged crimes) were duly examined under oath and through searching questions; finding probable cause, a warrant of arrest was issued against all the accused; the accused were directed to file their counter-affidavits but, instead of doing so, the defense filed a Motion to Correct Caption and to Lift the Warrant of Arrest issued; the first prayer was granted but the resolution of the second motion was held in abeyance until the counter-affidavits of all the accused are submitted; no counter-affidavits were filed so respondent resolved the cases and forwarded its records to the City Prosecutor's Office for the filing of proper Information. Respondent claims that: the conduct of the PI and the subsequent issuance of the warrant of arrest are well within the authority given in the City Charter which remains valid and enforceable until revoked by the Sangguniang Panlungsod of General Santos City; there was no usurpation of authority of an RTC Judge when she issued the assailed warrant of arrest as she has authority to do so under the City Charter; she examined only Acharon and Yagat because they were the witnesses to the alleged crimes and the questions propounded were never leading; there was no grave abuse of discretion when she held in abeyance the resolution of the prayer for the lifting of the warrant of arrest because the primary reason why it was withheld was the complainant's failure to submit a counter-affidavit; she did not personally know Acharon as she did not grow up in General Santos City; there is no conflict that the Rules on Criminal Procedure had undergone amendments but it would be very safe to say that the General Santos City Charter is not yet amended, hence, it still stands; and she believes that she did her duty to her very best in accordance with law and feels strongly offended and harassed by the filing of the instant case. For her defense, respondent avers that: in clean conscience she conducted the PI and thereafter issued the warrant of arrest in good faith and in accordance with law, jurisprudence and the rules and procedures; as a government employee since 1979, she had maintained a clean reputation; she even sacrificed and left her post as Senior Legal Officer of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), National Capital Region (NCR) in 1990 on the ground that she could not take the corruption around her; she had always kept her impartiality in making her decisions and never looked into the persons behind the party litigants; she rose through the ranks asking no favors from anyone and relied on her own skills, abilities, knowledge of the Constitution, laws, rules, regulations and jurisprudence and most especially her unblemished reputation; and with utmost dignity and head held high, respondent reiterates that she had not violated any of the provisions of the Constitution, or the Lawyers' and Judges' Oath, or any of the provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Code of Professional Responsibility, or Canons of Professional Ethics; and she had observed due process and did not misuse it to defeat the ends of justice. In its Memorandum [4] dated November 21, 2005, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) submitted its evaluation and recommendation, to wit: EVALUATION : After a careful perusal and consideration of the parties' respective positions and arguments, this Office finds no reasonable ground to hold the respondent administratively liable. Paragraph (5) Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution provides as follows: Sec. 5. The Supreme Court shall have the following powers: x x x (5) Promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleadings, practice and [enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading practice and] procedure in all courts, the admission to the practice of law, the Integrated Bar, and legal assistance to the underprivileged. Such rules shall provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases, shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade, and shall not diminish, increase or modify substantive rights. Rules of procedure of special courts and quasi-judicial bodies shall remain effective unless disapproved by the Supreme Court. Under the City Charter of General Santos City, the city court ""may also conduct preliminary investigation for any offense without regard to the limits of punishment and may release or commit and bind over any person charged with such offense to secure his appearance before the proper court"". However, considering the Honorable Court's power of supervision over all courts, rules of pleading, practice and procedure in all courts have been promulgated. And as a matter of policy and procedure, criminal cases covered by the Rule and initiated by a complaint is being referred to the City Prosecutor for appropriate action. In the case of Salcedo vs. Nobles-Banz, 134 SCRA 207, the Supreme Court ruled that: There is no question that under the Olongapo City Charter, the Municipal Trial Court can conduct preliminary investigation of all offenses. That is substantive law. However, pursuant to our constitutional supervision over all Courts, as a matter of policy, we direct the Municipal Trial Court in the City of Olongapo [that] whenever a criminal case covered by the Rule is initiated by complaint, to refer the same to the City Fiscal for the filing of the corresponding Information x x x. x x x The primary function of courts is to try and decide cases, not to conduct preliminary investigation. Thus, in Section 9 of the Rule on Summary Procedure in Special Cases effective August 1, 1983, the Court provided expressly that ""in Metro-Manila and chartered cities, (criminal) cases shall be commenced only by information"" at the instance of the metropolitan municipal trial court judges themselves who feared that they would be swamped with preliminary investigation which they would have to conduct (instead of cities' fiscals) if criminal complaints were to be directly filed with them. The Court has likewise adopted the same rule and policy in the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure effective January 1, 1985 governing the institution of all other offenses that ""in Metropolitan Manila and other chartered cities, the complaint may be filed only with the office of the fiscal."" (Rule 110, sec.1[b]). Further, it is worthy to state herein that it is the Public Prosecutor who is given by law ""direction and control"" of all criminal actions. It is he who is primarily responsible for ascertaining through a preliminary inquiry or proceeding ""whether there is reasonable ground to believe that an offense has been committed and the accused is probably guilty thereof."" Therefore, the preliminary investigation proper is not a judicial function, but an executive function, which is part of the prosecution's job. The assignment of this non-judicial function to judges of inferior courts was dictated by necessity and practical considerations because there are not enough fiscals and prosecutors to investigate crimes in all municipalities all over the country. In the case of Castillo vs. Villaluz, 171 SCRA 39, citing Salta vs. Court Administrator, 143 SCRA 228, the Honorable Court ruled that: Whenever there are enough fiscals or prosecutors to conduct preliminary investigation, courts are counseled to leave this job which is essentially executive to them. It appears that the City of General Santos already has sufficient number of prosecutors who can handle the preliminary investigation of criminal cases. Hence, the same should be referred to them for appropriate action. It is worth mentioning here that lately, the Honorable Court in A.M. No. 05-8-26-SC dated 30 August 2005 has already withdrawn the power to conduct preliminary investigation from the judges of the first level courts. Insofar as the issuance of warrant of arrest is concerned, par. (b), Sec. 6, Rule 112 provides: Sec. 6. When warrant of arrest may issue. - x x x (b) By the Municipal Trial Court. - When required pursuant to the second paragraph of section 1 of this Rule, the preliminary investigation of cases falling under the original jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Municipal Trial Court, or Municipal Circuit Trial Court may be conducted by either the judge or the prosecutor. x x x. When the investigation is conducted by the judge himself, he shall follow the procedure provided in Section 3 of this Rule. If his findings and recommendations are affirmed by the provincial or city prosecutor, or by the Ombudsman or his deputy, and the corresponding information is filed, he shall issue a warrant of arrest. However, without waiting for the conclusion of the investigation, the judge may issue a warrant of arrest if he finds after an examination in writing and under oath of the complainant and his witnesses in the form of searching questions and answers, that a probable cause exists and that there is a necessity of placing the respondent under immediate custody not to frustrate the ends of justice. Under the above-quoted rule, the power or authority of the investigating judge to issue a warrant of arrest is limited to those instances where there is a necessity of placing him in custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice. In the case of Mantaring vs. Roman, 254 SCRA 158, the respondent judge was reprimanded for issuing a warrant without any finding that it was necessary to place the accused in immediate custody in order to prevent a frustration of justice. And we quote: Moreover, we think it was improper for respondent judge to have issued the warrants of arrest against complainant and his son without any finding that it was necessary to place them in immediate custody in order to prevent a frustration of justice. It is now settled that in issuing warrants of arrest in preliminary investigations, the investigating judge must: (a) have examined in writing and under oath the complainant and his witnesses by searching questions and answers; (b)    be satisfied that probable cause exists; and (c) that there is a need to place the respondent under immediate custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice. In the instant case, it appears that respondent ordered the issuance of warrants of arrest against the complainant and his co-accused not only because of the existence of probable cause, but because of her finding that it was necessary to place them under immediate custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice. Pertinent portion of the Order of the court during the preliminary investigation held on 15 July 2004 is hereunder quoted as follows: ORDER: For preliminary investigation and request for immediate issuance of warrant of arrest. After a thorough examination of the complaining witness, Jose Orlando Acharon together with the eye-witness Edwin Yagat through searching questions under oath, the undersigned finds that there is reason to believe that the crimes of arson and robbery and there is a need to place in custody the named accused herein in order not to frustrate the ends of justice and also to prevent them from possibly committing the same crime in the other bunkhouses of the complaining witness, issue warrant of arrest against all the named accused with bailbond fixed at P200,000.00 each for Robbery and no bail for Arson. x x RECOMMENDATION :     Respectfully submitted for the consideration and approval of the Honorable Court our recommendations as follows: The instant case against Judge Marie Ellengrid S.L. Baliguat of MTCC, Branch 01 [G]eneral Santos City be DISMISSED for lack of merit; and Judge Baliguat be ADVISED to refer criminal cases filed for preliminary investigation to the Office of the City Prosecutor, General Santos City for appropriate action. [5] Meanwhile, in a Resolution [6] dated February 22, 2006, respondent was required to inform the Court as to the action taken by her on complainant's and his co-accused's motions dated July 24, 2004 and August 17, 2004, respectively, to lift the warrant of arrest and referral of Criminal Cases Nos. 46246 and 46247 to the Office of the City Prosecutor. In her Compliance [7] dated March 10, 2006, respondent avers that despite ample time given to the respondents to submit their counter-affidavit, they failed to do so and attaching thereto the Resolution [8] dated January 14, 2005, denying the Motion to Quash Warrant of Arrest for lack of merit and forwarded the records of Criminal Cases Nos. 46246 and 46247-I to the Office of the City Prosecutor for further proceedings. At issue is whether or not the acts committed by respondent judge constitute gross ignorance of the law, abuse of authority, dereliction of duty, and oppression warranting dismissal from judicial service and disbarment. We adopt the evaluation and recommendation of the OCA. Preliminary investigation is an inquiry or proceeding to determine whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and the respondent is probably guilty thereof and should be held for trial. [9] And prior to the issuance of A.M. No. 05-8-26-SC [10] which took effect on October 3, 2005, among the officers authorized by Sec. 2, Rule 112 [11] of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure to conduct preliminary investigation are the city prosecutors and judges of the MTC and MCTC. As provided under Sec. 37 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Judges of Metropolitan Trial Courts, except those in the National Capital Region, of Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts shall have authority to conduct preliminary investigation of crimes alleged to have been committed within their respective territorial jurisdictions which are cognizable by the Regional Trial Courts. x x x Provided, however, that, if after the preliminary investigation the Judge finds a prima facie case, he shall forward the records of the case to the Provincial/City Fiscal for the filing of the corresponding information with the proper court. No warrant of arrest shall be issued by the Judge in connection with any criminal complaint filed with him for preliminary investigation, unless after an examination in writing and under oath or affirmation of the complainant and his witnesses, he finds that a probable cause exists. x x x The Charter of General Santos City, specifically Sec. 84, [12] authorizes the city court to conduct preliminary investigations for any offense without regard to the limits of punishment and may release or commit and bind over any person charge[d] with such offense to secure his appearance before the proper court. Under Sec. 6(b), Rule 112 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, without waiting for the conclusion of the investigation, the judge may issue a warrant of arrest if he finds after an examination in writing and under oath of the complainant and his witnesses in the form of searching questions and answers, that a probable cause exists and that there is a necessity of placing the respondent under immediate custody not to frustrate the ends of justice. And as can be gleaned from the provision of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, [13] in Manila and other chartered cities, the complaint shall be filed with the office of the prosecutor unless otherwise provided in their charters. Thus, respondent did not commit gross ignorance of the law nor grave abuse of discretion in conducting the said PI. It is very clear from the aforementioned provision that city judges are authorized to conduct preliminary investigation and examination.  The conduct by respondent of the PI and the subsequent issuance of the warrant of arrest are well within the authority given under the substantive law as well as the Charter of General Santos City. Salcedo v. Nobles-Bans, [14] cited by the complainant, is not on all fours with the present case. In the said case, respondent judge dismissed the criminal cases covered by the Rules on Summary Procedure, instead of referring the same to the City Fiscal for the filing of the corresponding Informations. In the present case, what is being questioned was the PI conducted by the respondent and the subsequent issuance of the warrant of arrest, which is neither covered by the Rules on Summary Procedure nor dismissed by the respondent. In Ribaya v. Binamira-Parcia, [15] we held that as long as the constitutional mandate was complied with, that is, the warrant of arrest was issued upon a finding of probable cause personally by the judge after an examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, the warrant of arrest was valid. After all, the purpose of issuing the warrant of arrest was to place the respondents under immediate custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice; [16] and whether it is necessary to place the accused in custody is left to the judge's sound judgment. [17] As aptly found by the OCA in its evaluation, [18] respondent ordered the issuance of the warrants of arrest not only because of the existence of probable cause, but because of her finding that it was necessary to place the accused under immediate custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice. We find nothing irregular in the course of action taken by the respondent. We held in Jamora v. Bersales , [19] that when a preliminary investigation is conducted by a municipal court trial judge, he is obligated, upon conclusion of the preliminary investigation, to transmit to the provincial or city fiscal, for appropriate action, the resolution of the case. In this case, immediately after the determination of a probable cause, respondent judge forwarded the records of the criminal cases to the Office of the City Prosecutor for further proceedings which bespeaks of respondent's knowledge of the law, both substantive and procedural. However, as adverted to earlier, under A.M. No 05-8-26-SC, which took effect on October 3, 2005, the officers authorized to conduct preliminary investigations are the: (a) Provincial or City Prosecutors and their assistants; (b) National and Regional State Prosecutors; and (c) other officers as may be authorized by law. xxx [20] The preliminary investigation of cases falling under the original jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Municipal Trial Court or Municipal Circuit Trial Court shall be conducted by the prosecutor. xxx The above-mentioned administrative matter included the following proviso: All First Level Courts shall continue with the preliminary investigation of cases pending with them and terminate them not later than December 31, 2005. Upon the date of effectivity of these amendments, First Level Courts shall no longer accept new cases for preliminary investigation, which fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of courts of other levels. It must be emphasized that the conduct of respondent in the handling of the PI and the subsequent issuance of the warrants of arrest is well within the mandate of the law and not indicative of any grave abuse of discretion on her part. The criminal cases subject of this complaint were filed on July 15, 2004 and still governed by Rule 112 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure in force at the time of the commission of the crime charged; while A.M. No. 05-8-26-SC which took effect on October 3, 2005, commanded the first level courts to continue with the preliminary investigation of cases pending with them and terminate them not later than December 31, 2005. It is settled that as a matter of policy, the acts of a judge in his judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action. He cannot be subjected to liability - civil, criminal or administrative - for any of his official acts, no matter how erroneous, as long as he acts in good faith. [21] To hold, otherwise, would be to render judicial office untenable, for no one called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment. [22] An inquiry into the administrative liability of a judge may be resorted to only after the available remedies have been exhausted and decided with finality. [23] For until there is a final declaration by the appellate court that the challenged order or judgment is manifestly erroneous, there will be no basis to conclude whether respondent is administratively liable. [24] To constitute gross ignorance of the law, it is not enough that the subject decision, order or actuation of the judge in the performance of his official duties is contrary to existing law and jurisprudence but, most importantly, he must be moved by bad faith, fraud, dishonesty, or corruption. [25] Good faith and absence of malice, corrupt motives or improper considerations, are sufficient defenses in which a judge charged with ignorance of the law can find refuge. [26] In this case, we are convinced that respondent conducted the PI and the subsequent issuance of the warrants of arrest in clean conscience, in good faith and in accordance with law, jurisprudence, rules and procedures. WHEREFORE , premises considered, the administrative case against Judge Marie Ellengrid S.L. Baliguat, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Branch 1, General Santos City is DISMISSED . And in line with A.M. No. 05-8-26-SC, withdrawing the power to conduct preliminary investigation from judges of first level courts, she is ADVISED to refer criminal cases filed for preliminary investigation to the Office of the City Prosecutor, General Santos City for appropriate action.

NO. 153866. February 11, 2005 ] COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY (PHILIPPINES), RESPONDENT. DECISION PANGANIBAN, J.: Business companies registered in and operating from the Special Economic Zone in Naga, Cebu -- like herein respondent -- are entities exempt from all internal revenue taxes and the implementing rules relevant thereto, including the value-added taxes or VAT. Although export sales are not deemed exempt transactions , they are nonetheless zero-rated. Hence, in the present case, the distinction between exempt entities and exempt transactions has little significance, because the net result is that the taxpayer is not liable for the VAT. Respondent, a VAT-registered enterprise, has complied with all requisites for claiming a tax refund of or credit for the input VAT it paid on capital goods it purchased. Thus, the Court of Tax Appeals and the Court of Appeals did not err in ruling that it is entitled to such refund or credit. The Case Before us is a Petition for Review [1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to set aside the May 27, 2002 Decision [2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 66093. The decretal portion of the Decision reads as follows: “WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, the petition for review is DENIED for lack of merit.” [3] The Facts The CA quoted the facts narrated by the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), as follows: “As jointly stipulated by the parties, the pertinent facts x x x involved in this case are as follows: [Respondent] is a resident foreign corporation duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to do business in the Philippines, with principal office address at the new Cebu Township One, Special Economic Zone, Barangay Cantao-an, Naga, Cebu; [Petitioner] is sued in his official capacity, having been duly appointed and empowered to perform the duties of his office, including, among others, the duty to act and approve claims for refund or tax credit; [Respondent] is registered with the Philippine Export Zone Authority (PEZA) and has been issued PEZA Certificate No. 97-044 pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 66, as amended, to engage in the manufacture of recording components primarily used in computers for export. Such registration was made on 6 June 1997; [Respondent] is VAT [(Value Added Tax)]-registered entity as evidenced by VAT Registration Certification No. 97-083-000600-V issued on 2 April 1997; VAT returns for the period 1 April 1998 to 30 June 1999 have been filed by [respondent]; An administrative claim for refund of VAT input taxes in the amount of P28,369,226.38 with supporting documents (inclusive of the P12,267,981.04 VAT input taxes subject of this Petition for Review), was filed on 4 October 1999 with Revenue District Office No. 83, Talisay Cebu; No final action has been received by [respondent] from [petitioner] on [respondent’s] claim for VAT refund. “The administrative claim for refund by the [respondent] on October 4, 1999 was not acted upon by the [petitioner] prompting the [respondent] to elevate the case to [the CTA] on July 21, 2000 by way of Petition for Review in order to toll the running of the two-year prescriptive period. “For his part, [petitioner] x x x raised the following Special and Affirmative Defenses, to wit: [Respondent’s] alleged claim for tax refund/credit is subject to administrative routinary investigation/examination by [petitioner’s] Bureau; Since ‘taxes are presumed to have been collected in accordance with laws and regulations,’ the [respondent] has the burden of proof that the taxes sought to be refunded were erroneously or illegally collected x x x; In Citibank, N.A. vs. Court of Appeals , 280 SCRA 459 (1997), the Supreme Court ruled that: “A claimant has the burden of proof to establish the factual basis of his or her claim for tax credit/refund.” Claims for tax refund/tax credit are construed in ‘strictissimi juris’ against the taxpayer. This is due to the fact that claims for refund/credit [partake of] the nature of an exemption from tax. Thus, it is incumbent upon the [respondent] to prove that it is indeed entitled to the refund/credit sought. Failure on the part of the [respondent] to prove the same is fatal to its claim for tax credit. He who claims exemption must be able to justify his claim by the clearest grant of organic or statutory law. An exemption from the common burden cannot be permitted to exist upon vague implications; Granting, without admitting, that [respondent] is a Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) registered Ecozone Enterprise, then its business is not subject to VAT pursuant to Section 24 of Republic Act No. ([RA]) 7916 in relation to Section 103 of the Tax Code, as amended. As [respondent’s] business is not subject to VAT, the capital goods and services it alleged to have purchased are considered not used in VAT taxable business. As such, [respondent] is not entitled to refund of input taxes on such capital goods pursuant to Section 4.106.1 of Revenue Regulations No. ([RR])7-95, and of input taxes on services pursuant to Section 4.103 of said regulations. [Respondent] must show compliance with the provisions of Section 204 (C) and 229 of the 1997 Tax Code on filing of a written claim for refund within two (2) years from the date of payment of tax.’ “On July 19, 2001, the Tax Court rendered a decision granting the claim for refund.” [4] Ruling of the Court of Appeals The CA affirmed the Decision of the CTA granting the claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate (TCC) in favor of respondent in the reduced amount of P12,122,922.66. This sum represented the unutilized but substantiated input VAT paid on capital goods purchased for the period covering April 1, 1998 to June 30, 1999. The appellate court reasoned that respondent had availed itself only of the fiscal incentives under Executive Order No. (EO) 226 (otherwise known as the Omnibus Investment Code of 1987), not of those under both Presidential Decree No. (PD) 66, as amended, and Section 24 of RA 7916. Respondent was, therefore, considered exempt only from the payment of income tax when it opted for the income tax holiday in lieu of the 5 percent preferential tax on gross income earned. As a VAT-registered entity, though, it was still subject to the payment of other national internal revenue taxes, like the VAT. Moreover, the CA held that neither Section 109 of the Tax Code nor Sections 4.106-1 and 4.103-1 of RR 7-95 were applicable. Having paid the input VAT on the capital goods it purchased, respondent correctly filed the administrative and judicial claims for its refund within the two-year prescriptive period. Such payments were -- to the extent of the refundable value -- duly supported by VAT invoices or official receipts, and were not yet offset against any output VAT liability. Hence this Petition. [5] Sole Issue Petitioner submits this sole issue for our consideration: “Whether or not respondent is entitled to the refund or issuance of Tax Credit Certificate in the amount of P12,122,922.66 representing alleged unutilized input VAT paid on capital goods purchased for the period April 1, 1998 to June 30, 1999.” [6] The Court’s Ruling The Petition is unmeritorious. Sole Issue: Entitlement of a VAT-Registered PEZA Enterprise to a Refund of or Credit for Input VAT No doubt, as a PEZA-registered enterprise within a special economic zone, [7] respondent is entitled to the fiscal incentives and benefits [8] provided for in either PD 66 [9] or EO 226. [10] It shall, moreover, enjoy all privileges, benefits, advantages or exemptions under both Republic Act Nos. (RA) 7227 [11] and 7844. [12] Preferential Tax Treatment Under Special Laws If it avails itself of PD 66, notwithstanding the provisions of other laws to the contrary, respondent shall not be subject to internal revenue laws and regulations for raw materials, supplies, articles, equipment, machineries, spare parts and wares, except those prohibited by law, brought into the zone to be stored, broken up, repacked, assembled, installed, sorted, cleaned, graded or otherwise processed, manipulated, manufactured, mixed or used directly or indirectly in such activities. [13] Even so, respondent would enjoy a net-operating loss carry over; accelerated depreciation; foreign exchange and financial assistance; and exemption from export taxes, local taxes and licenses. [14] Comparatively, the same exemption from internal revenue laws and regulations applies if EO 226 [15] is chosen. Under this law, respondent shall further be entitled to an income tax holiday; additional deduction for labor expense; simplification of customs procedure; unrestricted use of consigned equipment; access to a bonded manufacturing warehouse system; privileges for foreign nationals employed; tax credits on domestic capital equipment, as well as for taxes and duties on raw materials; and exemption from contractors’ taxes, wharfage dues, taxes and duties on imported capital equipment and spare parts, export taxes, duties, imposts and fees, [16] local taxes and licenses, and real property taxes. [17] A privilege available to respondent under the provision in RA 7227 on tax and duty-free importation of raw materials, capital and equipment [18] -- is, ipso facto, also accorded to the zone [19] under RA 7916. Furthermore, the latter law -- notwithstanding other existing laws, rules and regulations to the contrary -- extends [20] to that zone the provision stating that no local or national taxes shall be imposed therein. [21] No exchange control policy shall be applied; and free markets for foreign exchange, gold, securities and future shall be allowed and maintained. [22] Banking and finance shall also be liberalized under minimum Bangko Sentral regulation with the establishment of foreign currency depository units of local commercial banks and offshore banking units of foreign banks. [23] In the same vein, respondent benefits under RA 7844 from negotiable tax credits [24] for locally-produced materials used as inputs. Aside from the other incentives possibly already granted to it by the Board of Investments, it also enjoys preferential credit facilities [25] and exemption from PD 1853. [26] From the above-cited laws, it is immediately clear that petitioner enjoys preferential tax treatment. [27] It is not subject to internal revenue laws and regulations and is even entitled to tax credits. The VAT on capital goods is an internal revenue tax from which petitioner as an entity is exempt. Although the transactions involving such tax are not exempt, petitioner as a VAT-registered person, [28] however, is entitled to their credits. Nature of the VAT and the Tax Credit Method Viewed broadly, the VAT is a uniform tax ranging, at present, from 0 percent to 10 percent levied on every importation of goods, whether or not in the course of trade or business, or imposed on each sale, barter, exchange or lease of goods or properties or on each rendition of services in the course of trade or business [29] as they pass along the production and distribution chain, the tax being limited only to the value added [30] to such goods, properties or services by the seller, transferor or lessor. [31] It is an indirect tax that may be shifted or passed on to the buyer, transferee or lessee of the goods, properties or services. [32] As such, it should be understood not in the context of the person or entity that is primarily, directly and legally liable for its payment, but in terms of its nature as a tax on consumption. [33] In either case, though, the same conclusion is arrived at. The law [34] that originally imposed the VAT in the country, as well as the subsequent amendments of that law, has been drawn from the tax credit method . [35] Such method adopted the mechanics and self-enforcement features of the VAT as first implemented and practiced in Europe and subsequently adopted in New Zealand and Canada. [36] Under the present method that relies on invoices, an entity can credit against or subtract from the VAT charged on its sales or outputs the VAT paid on its purchases, inputs and imports. [37] If at the end of a taxable quarter the output taxes [38] charged by a seller [39] are equal to the input taxes [40] passed on by the suppliers, no payment is required. It is when the output taxes exceed the input taxes that the excess has to be paid. [41] If, however, the input taxes exceed the output taxes, the excess shall be carried over to the succeeding quarter or quarters. [42] Should the input taxes result from zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions or from the acquisition of capital goods, [43] any excess over the output taxes shall instead be refunded [44] to the taxpayer or credited [45] against other internal revenue taxes. [46] Zero-Rated and Effectively Zero-Rated Transactions Although both are taxable and similar in effect, zero-rated transactions differ from effectively zero-rated transactions as to their source. Zero-rated transactions generally refer to the export sale of goods and supply of services. [47] The tax rate is set at zero. [48] When applied to the tax base, such rate obviously results in no tax chargeable against the purchaser. The seller of such transactions charges no output tax, [49] but can claim a refund of or a tax credit certificate for the VAT previously charged by suppliers. Effectively zero-rated transactions , however, refer to the sale of goods [50] or supply of services [51] to persons or entities whose exemption under special laws or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory effectively subjects such transactions to a zero rate. [52] Again, as applied to the tax base, such rate does not yield any tax chargeable against the purchaser. The seller who charges zero output tax on such transactions can also claim a refund of or a tax credit certificate for the VAT previously charged by suppliers. Zero Rating and Exemption In terms of the VAT computation , zero rating and exemption are the same, but the extent of relief that results from either one of them is not. Applying the destination principle [53] to the exportation of goods, automatic zero rating [54] is primarily intended to be enjoyed by the seller who is directly and legally liable for the VAT, making such seller internationally competitive by allowing the refund or credit of input taxes that are attributable to export sales. [55] Effective zero rating, on the contrary, is intended to benefit the purchaser who, not being directly and legally liable for the payment of the VAT, will ultimately bear the burden of the tax shifted by the suppliers. In both instances of zero rating, there is total relief for the purchaser from the burden of the tax. [56] But in an exemption there is only partial relief , [57] because the purchaser is not allowed any tax refund of or credit for input taxes paid. [58] Exempt Transaction and Exempt Party The object of exemption from the VAT may either be the transaction itself or any of the parties to the transaction. [59] An exempt transaction , on the one hand, involves goods or services which, by their nature, are specifically listed in and expressly exempted from the VAT under the Tax Code, without regard to the tax status --VAT-exempt or not -- of the party to the transaction. [60] Indeed, such transaction is not subject to the VAT, but the seller is not allowed any tax refund of or credit for any input taxes paid. An exempt party , on the other hand, is a person or entity granted VAT exemption under the Tax Code, a special law or an international agreement to which the Philippines is a signatory, and by virtue of which its taxable transactions become exempt from the VAT. [61] Such party is also not subject to the VAT, but may be allowed a tax refund of or credit for input taxes paid, depending on its registration as a VAT or non-VAT taxpayer. As mentioned earlier, the VAT is a tax on consumption, the amount of which may be shifted or passed on by the seller to the purchaser of the goods, properties or services. [62] While the liability is imposed on one person, the burden may be passed on to another. Therefore, if a special law merely exempts a party as a seller from its direct liability for payment of the VAT, but does not relieve the same party as a purchaser from its indirect burden of the VAT shifted to it by its VAT-registered suppliers, the purchase transaction is not exempt. Applying this principle to the case at bar, the purchase transactions entered into by respondent are not VAT-exempt. Special laws may certainly exempt transactions from the VAT. [63] However, the Tax Code provides that those falling under PD 66 are not. PD 66 is the precursor of RA 7916 -- the special law under which respondent was registered. The purchase transactions it entered into are, therefore, not VAT-exempt. These are subject to the VAT; respondent is required to register. Its sales transactions, however, will either be zero-rated or taxed at the standard rate of 10 percent, [64] depending again on the application of the destination principle . [65] If respondent enters into such sales transactions with a purchaser -- usually in a foreign country -- for use or consumption outside the Philippines, these shall be subject to 0 percent. [66] If entered into with a purchaser for use or consumption in the Philippines, then these shall be subject to 10 percent, [67] unless the purchaser is exempt from the indirect burden of the VAT, in which case it shall also be zero-rated. Since the purchases of respondent are not exempt from the VAT, the rate to be applied is zero. Its exemption under both PD 66 and RA 7916 effectively subjects such transactions to a zero rate, [68] because the ecozone within which it is registered is managed and operated by the PEZA as a separate customs territory . [69] This means that in such zone is created the legal fiction of foreign territory. [70] Under the cross-border principle [71] of the VAT system being enforced by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), [72] no VAT shall be imposed to form part of the cost of goods destined for consumption outside of the territorial border of the taxing authority. If exports of goods and services from the Philippines to a foreign country are free of the VAT, [73] then the same rule holds for such exports from the national territory -- except specifically declared areas -- to an ecozone. Sales made by a VAT-registered person in the customs territory to a PEZA-registered entity are considered exports to a foreign country; conversely, sales by a PEZA-registered entity to a VAT-registered person in the customs territory are deemed imports from a foreign country. [74] An ecozone -- indubitably a geographical territory of the Philippines -- is, however, regarded in law as foreign soil. [75] This legal fiction is necessary to give meaningful effect to the policies of the special law creating the zone. [76] If respondent is located in an export processing zone [77] within that ecozone, sales to the export processing zone, even without being actually exported, shall in fact be viewed as constructively exported under EO 226. [78] Considered as export sales, [79] such purchase transactions by respondent would indeed be subject to a zero rate. [80] Tax Exemptions Broad and Express Applying the special laws we have earlier discussed, respondent as an entity is exempt from internal revenue laws and regulations. This exemption covers both direct and indirect taxes, stemming from the very nature of the VAT as a tax on consumption, for which the direct liability is imposed on one person but the indirect burden is passed on to another. Respondent, as an exempt entity, can neither be directly charged for the VAT on its sales nor indirectly made to bear, as added cost to such sales, the equivalent VAT on its purchases. Ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguere debemus . Where the law does not distinguish, we ought not to distinguish. Moreover, the exemption is both express and pervasive for the following reasons: First , RA 7916 states that “no taxes, local and national, shall be imposed on business establishments operating within the ecozone.” [81] Since this law does not exclude the VAT from the prohibition, it is deemed included. Exceptio firmat regulam in casibus non exceptis . An exception confirms the rule in cases not excepted; that is, a thing not being excepted must be regarded as coming within the purview of the general rule. Moreover, even though the VAT is not imposed on the entity but on the transaction, it may still be passed on and, therefore, indirectly imposed on the same entity -- a patent circumvention of the law. That no VAT shall be imposed directly upon business establishments operating within the ecozone under RA 7916 also means that no VAT may be passed on and imposed indirectly. Quando aliquid prohibetur ex directo prohibetur et per obliquum . When anything is prohibited directly, it is also prohibited indirectly. Second , when RA 8748 was enacted to amend RA 7916, the same prohibition applied, except for real property taxes that presently are imposed on land owned by developers. [82] This similar and repeated prohibition is an unambiguous ratification of the law’s intent in not imposing local or national taxes on business enterprises within the ecozone. Third , foreign and domestic merchandise, raw materials, equipment and the like “shall not be subject to x x x internal revenue laws and regulations” under PD 66 [83] -- the original charter of PEZA (then EPZA) that was later amended by RA 7916. [84] No provisions in the latter law modify such exemption. Although this exemption puts the government at an initial disadvantage, the reduced tax collection ultimately redounds to the benefit of the national economy by enticing more business investments and creating more employment opportunities. [85] Fourth , even the rules implementing the PEZA law clearly reiterate that merchandise -- except those prohibited by law -- “shall not be subject to x x x internal revenue laws and regulations x x x” [86] if brought to the ecozone’s restricted area [87] for manufacturing by registered export enterprises, [88] of which respondent is one. These rules also apply to all enterprises registered with the EPZA prior to the effectivity of such rules. [89] Fifth , export processing zone enterprises registered [90] with the Board of Investments (BOI) under EO 226 patently enjoy exemption from national internal revenue taxes on imported capital equipment reasonably needed and exclusively used for the manufacture of their products; [91] on required supplies and spare part for consigned equipment; [92] and on foreign and domestic merchandise, raw materials, equipment and the like -- except those prohibited by law -- brought into the zone for manufacturing. [93] In addition, they are given credits for the value of the national internal revenue taxes imposed on domestic capital equipment also reasonably needed and exclusively used for the manufacture of their products, [94] as well as for the value of such taxes imposed on domestic raw materials and supplies that are used in the manufacture of their export products and that form part thereof. [95] Sixth , the exemption from local and national taxes granted under RA 7227 [96] are ipso facto accorded to ecozones. [97] In case of doubt, conflicts with respect to such tax exemption privilege shall be resolved in favor of the ecozone. [98] And seventh , the tax credits under RA 7844 -- given for imported raw materials primarily used in the production of export goods, [99] and for locally produced raw materials, capital equipment and spare parts used by exporters of non-traditional products [100] --shall also be continuously enjoyed by similar exporters within the ecozone. [101] Indeed, the latter exporters are likewise entitled to such tax exemptions and credits. Tax Refund as Tax Exemption To be sure, statutes that grant tax exemptions are construed strictissimi juris [102] against the taxpayer [103] and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. [104] Tax refunds are in the nature of such exemptions. [105] Accordingly, the claimants of those refunds bear the burden of proving the factual basis of their claims; [106] and of showing, by words too plain to be mistaken, that the legislature intended to exempt them. [107] In the present case, all the cited legal provisions are teeming with life with respect to the grant of tax exemptions too vivid to pass unnoticed. In addition, respondent easily meets the challenge. Respondent, which as an entity is exempt, is different from its transactions which are not exempt. The end result, however, is that it is not subject to the VAT. The non-taxability of transactions that are otherwise taxable is merely a necessary incident to the tax exemption conferred by law upon it as an entity, not upon the transactions themselves. [108] Nonetheless, its exemption as an entity and the non-exemption of its transactions lead to the same result for the following considerations: First , the contemporaneous construction of our tax laws by BIR authorities who are called upon to execute or administer such laws [109] will have to be adopted. Their prior tax issuances have held inconsistent positions brought about by their probable failure to comprehend and fully appreciate the nature of the VAT as a tax on consumption and the application of the destination principle . [110] Revenue Memorandum Circular No. (RMC) 74-99, however, now clearly and correctly provides that any VAT-registered supplier’s sale of goods, property or services from the customs territory to any registered enterprise operating in the ecozone -- regardless of the class or type of the latter’s PEZA registration --is legally entitled to a zero rate. [111] Second , the policies of the law should prevail. Ratio legis est anima . The reason for the law is its very soul. In PD 66, the urgent creation of the EPZA which preceded the PEZA, as well as the establishment of export processing zones, seeks “to encourage and promote foreign commerce as a means of x x x strengthening our export trade and foreign exchange position, of hastening industrialization, of reducing domestic unemployment, and of accelerating the development of the country.” [112] RA 7916, as amended by RA 8748, declared that by creating the PEZA and integrating the special economic zones, “the government shall actively encourage, promote, induce and accelerate a sound and balanced industrial, economic and social development of the country x x x through the establishment, among others, of special economic zones x x x that shall effectively attract legitimate and productive foreign investments.” [113] Under EO 226, the “State shall encourage x x x foreign investments in industry x x x which shall x x x meet the tests of international competitiveness[,] accelerate development of less developed regions of the country[,] and result in increased volume and value of exports for the economy.” [114] Fiscal incentives that are cost-efficient and simple to administer shall be devised and extended to significant projects “to compensate for market imperfections, to reward performance contributing to economic development,” [115] and “to stimulate the establishment and assist initial operations of the enterprise.” [116] Wisely accorded to ecozones created under RA 7916 [117] was the government’s policy -- spelled out earlier in RA 7227 -- of converting into alternative productive uses [118] the former military reservations and their extensions, [119] as well as of providing them incentives [120] to enhance the benefits that would be derived from them [121] in promoting economic and social development. [122] Finally, under RA 7844, the State declares the need “to evolve export development into a national effort” [123] in order to win international markets. By providing many export and tax incentives, [124] the State is able to drive home the point that exporting is indeed “the key to national survival and the means through which the economic goals of increased employment and enhanced incomes can most expeditiously be achieved.” [125] The Tax Code itself seeks to “promote sustainable economic growth x x x; x x x increase economic activity; and x x x create a robust environment for business to enable firms to compete better in the regional as well as the global market.” [126] After all, international competitiveness requires economic and tax incentives to lower the cost of goods produced for export. State actions that affect global competition need to be specific and selective in the pricing of particular goods or services. [127] All these statutory policies are congruent to the constitutional mandates of providing incentives to needed investments, [128] as well as of promoting the preferential use of domestic materials and locally produced goods and adopting measures to help make these competitive. [129] Tax credits for domestic inputs strengthen backward linkages. Rightly so, “the rule of law and the existence of credible and efficient public institutions are essential prerequisites for sustainable economic development.” [130] VAT Registration, Not Application for Effective Zero Rating, Indispensable to VAT Refund Registration is an indispensable requirement under our VAT law. [131] Petitioner alleges that respondent did register for VAT purposes with the appropriate Revenue District Office. However, it is now too late in the day for petitioner to challenge the VAT-registered status of respondent, given the latter’s prior representation before the lower courts and the mode of appeal taken by petitioner before this Court. The PEZA law, which carried over the provisions of the EPZA law, is clear in exempting from internal revenue laws and regulations the equipment -- including capital goods -- that registered enterprises will use, directly or indirectly, in manufacturing. [132] EO 226 even reiterates this privilege among the incentives it gives to such enterprises. [133] Petitioner merely asserts that by virtue of the PEZA registration alone of respondent, the latter is not subject to the VAT. Consequently, the capital goods and services respondent has purchased are not considered used in the VAT business, and no VAT refund or credit is due. [134] This is a non sequitur. By the VAT’s very nature as a tax on consumption, the capital goods and services respondent has purchased are subject to the VAT, although at zero rate. Registration does not determine taxability under the VAT law. Moreover, the facts have already been determined by the lower courts. Having failed to present evidence to support its contentions against the income tax holiday privilege of respondent, [135] petitioner is deemed to have conceded. It is a cardinal rule that “issues and arguments not adequately and seriously brought below cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.” [136] This is a “matter of procedure” [137] and a “question of fairness.” [138] Failure to assert “within a reasonable time warrants a presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned or declined to assert it.” [139] The BIR regulations additionally requiring an approved prior application for effective zero rating [140] cannot prevail over the clear VAT nature of respondent’s transactions . The scope of such regulations is not “within the statutory authority x x x granted by the legislature. [141] First , a mere administrative issuance, like a BIR regulation, cannot amend the law; the former cannot purport to do any more than interpret the latter. [142] The courts will not countenance one that overrides the statute it seeks to apply and implement. [143] Other than the general registration of a taxpayer the VAT status of which is aptly determined, no provision under our VAT law requires an additional application to be made for such taxpayer’s transactions to be considered effectively zero-rated. An effectively zero-rated transaction does not and cannot become exempt simply because an application therefor was not made or, if made, was denied. To allow the additional requirement is to give unfettered discretion to those officials or agents who, without fluid consideration, are bent on denying a valid application. Moreover, the State can never be estopped by the omissions, mistakes or errors of its officials or agents. [144] Second , grantia argumenti that such an application is required by law, there is still the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty. [145] Respondent’s registration carries with it the presumption that, in the absence of contradictory evidence, an application for effective zero rating was also filed and approval thereof given. Besides, it is also presumed that the law has been obeyed [146] by both the administrative officials and the applicant. Third , even though such an application was not made, all the special laws we have tackled exempt respondent not only from internal revenue laws but also from the regulations issued pursuant thereto. Leniency in the implementation of the VAT in ecozones is an imperative, precisely to spur economic growth in the country and attain global competitiveness as envisioned in those laws. A VAT-registered status, as well as compliance with the invoicing requirements, [147] is sufficient for the effective zero rating of the transactions of a taxpayer. The nature of its business and transactions can easily be perused from, as already clearly indicated in, its VAT registration papers and photocopied documents attached thereto. Hence, its transactions cannot be exempted by its mere failure to apply for their effective zero rating. Otherwise, their VAT exemption would be determined, not by their nature, but by the taxpayer’s negligence -- a result not at all contemplated. Administrative convenience cannot thwart legislative mandate. Tax Refund or Credit in Order Having determined that respondent’s purchase transactions are subject to a zero VAT rate, the tax refund or credit is in order. As correctly held by both the CA and the Tax Court, respondent had chosen the fiscal incentives in EO 226 over those in RA 7916 and PD 66. It opted for the income tax holiday regime instead of the 5 percent preferential tax regime . The latter scheme is not a perfunctory aftermath of a simple registration under the PEZA law, [148] for EO 226 [149] also has provisions to contend with. These two regimes are in fact incompatible and cannot be availed of simultaneously by the same entity. While EO 226 merely exempts it from income taxes, the PEZA law exempts it from all taxes. Therefore, respondent can be considered exempt, not from the VAT, but only from the payment of income tax for a certain number of years, depending on its registration as a pioneer or a non-pioneer enterprise. Besides, the remittance of the aforesaid 5 percent of gross income earned in lieu of local and national taxes imposable upon business establishments within the ecozone cannot outrightly determine a VAT exemption. Being subject to VAT, payments erroneously collected thereon may then be refunded or credited. Even if it is argued that respondent is subject to the 5 percent preferential tax regime in RA 7916, Section 24 thereof does not preclude the VAT. One can, therefore, counterargue that such provision merely exempts respondent from taxes imposed on business. To repeat, the VAT is a tax imposed on consumption, not on business. Although respondent as an entity is exempt, the transactions it enters into are not necessarily so. The VAT payments made in excess of the zero rate that is imposable may certainly be refunded or credited. Compliance with All Requisites for VAT Refund or Credit As further enunciated by the Tax Court, respondent complied with all the requisites for claiming a VAT refund or credit. [150] First , respondent is a VAT-registered entity. This fact alone distinguishes the present case from Contex , in which this Court held that the petitioner therein was registered as a non-VAT taxpayer. [151] Hence, for being merely VAT-exempt, the petitioner in that case cannot claim any VAT refund or credit. Second , the input taxes paid on the capital goods of respondent are duly supported by VAT invoices and have not been offset against any output taxes. Although enterprises registered with the BOI after December 31, 1994 would no longer enjoy the tax credit incentives on domestic capital equipment -- as provided for under Article 39(d), Title III, Book I of EO 226 [152] -- starting January 1, 1996, respondent would still have the same benefit under a general and express exemption contained in both Article 77(1), Book VI of EO 226; and Section 12, paragraph 2 (c) of RA 7227, extended to the ecozones by RA 7916. There was a very clear intent on the part of our legislators, not only to exempt investors in ecozones from national and local taxes, but also to grant them tax credits. This fact was revealed by the sponsorship speeches in Congress during the second reading of House Bill No. 14295, which later became RA 7916, as shown below: ”MR. RECTO. x x x Some of the incentives that this bill provides are exemption from national and local taxes; x x x tax credit for locally-sourced inputs x x x.“ x x x    x x x     x x x ”MR. DEL MAR. x x x To advance its cause in encouraging investments and creating an environment conducive for investors, the bill offers incentives such as the exemption from local and national taxes, x x x tax credits for locally sourced inputs x x x.“ [153] And third , no question as to either the filing of such claims within the prescriptive period or the validity of the VAT returns has been raised. Even if such a question were raised, the tax exemption under all the special laws cited above is broad enough to cover even the enforcement of internal revenue laws, including prescription. [154] Summary To summarize, special laws expressly grant preferential tax treatment to business establishments registered and operating within an ecozone, which by law is considered as a separate customs territory . As such, respondent is exempt from all internal revenue taxes, including the VAT, and regulations pertaining thereto. It has opted for the income tax holiday regime , instead of the 5 percent preferential tax regime . As a matter of law and procedure, its registration status entitling it to such tax holiday can no longer be questioned. Its sales transactions intended for export may not be exempt, but like its purchase transactions , they are zero-rated. No prior application for the effective zero rating of its transactions is necessary. Being VAT-registered and having satisfactorily complied with all the requisites for claiming a tax refund of or credit for the input VAT paid on capital goods purchased, respondent is entitled to such VAT refund or credit.
